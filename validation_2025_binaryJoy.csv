0,10.1111/jgs.18065,Successful aging after elective surgery II: Study design and methods,"Background: The Successful Aging after Elective Surgery (SAGES) II study was designed to increase knowledge of the pathophysiology and linkages between delirium and dementia. We examine novel biomarkers potentially associated with delirium, including inflammation, Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology and neurodegeneration, neuroimaging markers, and neurophysiologic markers. The goal of this paper is to describe the study design and methods for the SAGES II study. Methods: The SAGES II study is a 5-year prospective observational study of 400�420 community dwelling persons, aged 65 years and older, assessed prior to scheduled surgery and followed daily throughout hospitalization to observe for development of delirium and other clinical outcomes. Delirium is measured with the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM), long form, after cognitive testing. Cognitive function is measured with a detailed neuropsychologic test battery, summarized as a weighted composite, the General Cognitive Performance (GCP) score. Other key measures include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)/electroencephalography (EEG), and Amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. We describe the eligibility criteria, enrollment flow, timing of assessments, and variables collected at baseline and during repeated assessments at 1, 2, 6, 12, and 18 months. Results: This study describes the hospital and surgery-related variables, delirium, long-term cognitive decline, clinical outcomes, and novel biomarkers. In inter-rater reliability assessments, the CAM ratings (weighted kappa�=�0.91, 95% confidence interval, CI�=�0.74�1.0) in 50 paired assessments and GCP ratings (weighted kappa�=�0.99, 95% CI 0.94�1.0) in 25 paired assessments. We describe procedures for data quality assurance and Covid-19 adaptations. Conclusions: This complex study presents an innovative effort to advance our understanding of the inter-relationship between delirium and dementia via novel biomarkers, collected in the context of major surgery in older adults. Strengths include the integration of MRI, TMS/EEG, PET modalities, and high-quality longitudinal data. � 2022 The American Geriatrics Society.",Hshieh T.T.; Schmitt E.M.; Fong T.G.; Arnold S.; Cavallari M.; Dickerson B.C.; Dillon S.T.; Jones R.N.; Libermann T.A.; Marcantonio E.R.; Pascual-Leone A.; Shafi M.M.; Touroutoglou A.; Travison T.G.; Gou R.Y.; Tommet D.; Abdeen A.; Earp B.; Kunze L.; Lange J.; Vlassakov K.; Inouye S.K.,"Hshieh, Tammy T.

However, the effect of stress on psychological adjustment in nursing home residents is unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the relationship between stress and psychological adjustment among nursing home residents. Methods: This was a cross-sectional, multicenter survey. A total of 386 residents from 11 nursing homes were included in the study. Bootstrapping with resampling strategies was used to examine multiple mediators and the moderator effect. This research conforms with the STROBE checklist. Results: Path analysis demonstrated that stress directly negatively predicted the psychological adjustment of nursing home residents. It also indirectly predicted psychological adjustment through the mediating role of learned resourcefulness and self-efficacy, as well as the chain mediating role of both. Social support played a moderating role in the path of stress to learned resourcefulness. Conclusion: This study revealed the mechanism underlying the effect of stress on psychological adjustment in nursing home residents without cognitive impairment and walking difficulties. It further suggests that health providers could enhance older adults' learned resourcefulness, self-efficacy, and social support to assist them in adjusting to nursing home life. � 2023, The Author(s).",Yong B.; Zhang Y.; Xiao H.,"Yong, Binbin (57208627581); Zhang, Yanyan (58080816600); Xiao, Huimin (15823216000)",57208627581; 58080816600; 15823216000,2023,BMC Geriatrics,23,1,52,,,,0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146931861&doi=10.1186%2fs12877-023-03758-9&partnerID=40&md5=50071c2b1b552bb6c3f000e6380e6e09,Aged; China; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Learning; Nursing Homes; Quality of Life; Skilled Nursing Facilities; aged; China; clinical trial; cross-sectional study; epidemiology; human; learning; multicenter study; nursing home; psychology; quality of life,mediating effect; moderating effect; Nursing home adjustment; older adults,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85146931861,1,0,0,China,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,386,0,0,0,0,NA,Successful Aging ,
2,10.3390/ijerph20021606,Subjective Functional Difficulties and Subjective Cognitive Decline in Older-Age Adults: Moderation by Age Cohorts and Mediation by Mentally Unhealthy Days,"Background and Objectives: Despite the expected positive association between subjective functional difficulties (SFD) and subjective cognitive decline (SCD), their mediation by mentally unhealthy days (MUDs) is under-studied. Moreover, few SCD studies have examined affective reactivity to functional difficulties by age cohort. This study examined the mediation effect of MUDs on the association between SFD and SCD by age cohorts� moderation among older adults. Methods: Using a cross-sectional design approach, we used the 2019 BRFSS dataset on 13,377 older adults aged 65 to ?80 (44% males and 56% females). Results: The bias-corrected percentile bootstrap with 5000 samplings revealed that MUDs partially mediate the relationship between SFD and SCD (14.12% mediation effect), controlling depressive symptoms, education, income levels, and race. Age cohorts moderated the relationship between SFD and SCD and between SFD and SCD but not between MUDs and SCD. The predictive effects of the path from SFD to MUDs and from MUDs to SCD were stronger in the younger-old (65�69) than the middle-old (70�79) and oldest-old (?80) age cohorts. Worse SCD was associated with being Asian, in female older adults, and in those with lower education and income levels. Conclusions: These findings extend the chronic stress theory predictions that accentuated emotional vulnerability to subjective functional difficulties may magnify SCD, particularly in the younger-old age group. By implication, preventive SCD interventions should seek to support younger-old adults in their activities of daily life for successful aging transitioning into older-age cohorts. � 2023 by the authors.",Komalasari R.; Mpofu E.; Prybutok G.; Ingman S.,"Komalasari, Renata (57205348595); Mpofu, Elias (7004684441); Prybutok, Gayle (55674277200); Ingman, Stanley (6602835342)",57205348595; 7004684441; 55674277200; 6602835342,2023,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,20,2,1606,,,,0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146616578&doi=10.3390%2fijerph20021606&partnerID=40&md5=0c5eb84360a760470d02a3fa3091d4e5,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aging; Cognitive Dysfunction; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; age structure; bootstrapping; cognition; cohort analysis; elderly population; mental disorder; vulnerability; aged; aging; cognitive defect; cross-sectional study; female; human; male; psychology; very elderly",affective reactivity; chronic stress theory of aging; depressive symptoms; mentally unhealthy days; subjective cognitive decline; subjective functional difficulties,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85146616578,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,13337,1,1,0,0,NA,Successful Aging ,
3,10.1016/j.archger.2022.104801,Examining the Combined Effects of Social Isolation and Loneliness on Memory: A Systematic Review,"Background: Some research suggests social isolation and loneliness are important risk factors for reduced successful aging and cognitive health. However, findings are inconsistent and no prior systematic review has investigated whether social isolation and loneliness are associated with the memory domain of cognition. This review examined whether social isolation and loneliness individually and jointly affected the memory of middle- and older-aged adults. Methods: We used PubMed, PsycInfo, and Scopus to search for comparative studies that examined the impact of both loneliness and social isolation (e.g., social activity, social networks) on memory (including all subtypes) in populations aged ? 45 years. Three raters performed data extraction and risk of bias assessment using the Joanna Briggs Institute checklist. Data were synthesized narratively following the Synthesis without Meta-Analysis guideline. Results: In 12 included articles, higher levels of loneliness and social isolation (combining a range of different indicators) were associated with lower memory performance, where the interaction between loneliness and social isolation had the largest adverse effect on memory, followed by social isolation alone, and followed by loneliness alone. However, substantial heterogeneity was observed in the composition of the two most common indicators of social isolation (social network size, social activity participation), with the magnitude of most results being clinically non-important. Most articles had moderate risk of bias. Conclusion: This review found an inverse association between social isolation/loneliness and memory, and outlines future steps to systematically combine the two constructs and measure social isolation in a consistent, multi-modal format. � 2022",Kang J.W.; Oremus M.,"Kang, Ji Won (57871903400); Oremus, Mark (6601946833)",57871903400; 6601946833,2023,Archives of Gerontology and Geriatrics,104,,104801,,,,1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137167742&doi=10.1016%2fj.archger.2022.104801&partnerID=40&md5=5a0da777b6cde64c3c131de003994620,Adult; Aging; Cognition; Humans; Loneliness; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Social Isolation; aging; cognition; comparative study; data extraction; human; human experiment; Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal checklist; loneliness; Medline; memory; meta analysis; practice guideline; PsycINFO; review; risk assessment; Scopus; social behavior; social isolation; social network; synthesis; systematic review; adult; aging; cognition; middle aged; psychology; risk factor,Aging; Cognition; Loneliness; Memory; Social isolation,Review,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85137167742,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,NA,Successful Aging ,

With increased investments in home and community-based services, public health stakeholders are considering home modifications to promote successful aging. While several home modification models exist, there is significant heterogeneity between models and no consensus on critical features. PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science were reviewed and twelve randomized controlled trials of home modifications for older adults were identified and evaluated for model structure, reported outcomes, and risk of bias. Overall, occupational therapist-driven home modifications supplemented with clinical, physical activity, and/or behavioral components saw the greatest success. This systematic review discusses the components of these models, highlights particularly effective and frequently used features, and the practice and research needed to create effective next-generation home modification models which promote healthy longevity. � The Author(s) 2023.",Sheth S.; Cogle C.R.,"Sheth, Sohum (58088378200); Cogle, Christopher R.

Intergenerational support is crucial for Chinese older adults in later life due to the culture of filial piety. However, the association between successful aging and intergenerational support remains poorly understood in China. This study aimed to examine the association between patterns of intergenerational support and successful aging of older adults in China. The present study is a secondary analysis of data obtained from the follow-up survey of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study 2018. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and logistic regressions. Bidirectional intergenerational support was associated with successful aging in the participants. In addition, there was an association between different intergenerational financial, caring, and emotional support patterns and elements of successful aging. � 2022 Elsevier Inc.",Zhao Y.; Tang L.; Zeng Q.-W.; Bu F.; Zhan N.-N.; Wang Z.-L.; Deng X.-H.; Lyu Q.-Y.,"Zhao, Yu (57320236000); Tang, Li (57320794900); Zeng, Qing-wei (57874145100); Bu, Fan (57874337500); Zhan, Na-ni (57874337600); Wang, Zi-lin (57873786600); Deng, Xiao-hui (57874522600); Lyu, Qi-yuan (56724680200)",57320236000; 57320794900; 57874145100; 57874337500; 57874337600; 57873786600; 57874522600; 56724680200,2023,Geriatric Nursing,49,,,81,88,7,0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85142752173&doi=10.1016%2fj.gerinurse.2022.11.010&partnerID=40&md5=f4c10d36d3ac39ca86dab9893ef3b70a,Aged; Aging; China; Humans; Intergenerational Relations; Longitudinal Studies; Retirement; Surveys and Questionnaires; aged; aging; article; care behavior; China; emotional support; female; follow up; human; human experiment; longitudinal study; male; retirement; secondary analysis; China; human relation; questionnaire; retirement,CHARLS; Intergenerational support; Older adults; Successful aging,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85142752173,1,0,0,China ,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,NA,Successful Aging ,

Planning for aging and frailty offers an opportunity for older adults to optimize their well-being and proactively prepare across their aging trajectory. The current study evaluated the relationship between contextual factors (functional status, frailty, health status, social support) that influence older adults� readiness to engage in planning in five domains of aging (communication, environmental, financial, physical care, cognitive) through the transtheoretical stages of change. Results showed that factors influencing active planning include older age, vulnerability, living situation, and social support. These results add to the discourse on future care planning through a comprehensive approach to planning across a life course perspective, while highlighting the importance of future research at individual and societal levels.

7,10.1186/s12877-022-02918-7,Development and psychometric evaluation of the Physical Resilience Instrument for Older Adults (PRIFOR),"Background: Physical resilience is known to minimize the adverse outcomes of health stressors for older people. However, validated instruments that assess physical resilience in older adults are rare. Therefore, we aimed to validate the Physical Resilience Instrument for Older Adults (PRIFOR) to fill the literature gap. Methods: Content analysis with content validity was first carried out to generate relevant items assessing physical resilience for older adults, and 19 items were developed. Psychometric evaluation of the 19 items was then tested on 200 older adults (mean [SD] age = 76.4 [6.6] years; 51.0% women) for item properties, factor structure, item fit, internal consistency, criterion-related validity, and known-group validity. Results: All 19 items had satisfactory item properties, as they were normally distributed (skewness = -1.03 to 0.38; kurtosis = -1.05 to 0.32). However, two items were removed due to substantial ceiling effects. The retained 17 items were embedded in three factors as suggested by the exploratory factor analysis (EFA)�results. All items except one had satisfactory item fit statistics�in Rasch model; thus, the unidimensionality was supported for the three factors on 16 items. The retained 16 items showed promising properties in known-group validity, criterion-related validity, and internal consistency (? = 0.94). Conclusions: The 16-item PRIFOR exhibits good psychometric properties. Using this instrument to measure physical resilience would be beneficial to identify factors that could protect older people from negative health consequence. With the use of the PRIFOR, intervention effects could also be evaluated. It is helpful to strengthen resilience and thereby facilitate successful aging. � 2022, The Author(s).",Hu F.-W.; Lin C.-H.; Yueh F.-R.; Lo Y.-T.; Lin C.-Y.,"Hu, Fang-Wen (56473190700); Lin, Cheng-Han (35754539200); Yueh, Fang-Ru (56432616600); Lo, Yu-Tai (57230345700); Lin, Chung-Ying (37124450500)",56473190700; 35754539200; 56432616600; 57230345700; 37124450500,2022,BMC Geriatrics,22,1,229,,,,1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126729059&doi=10.1186%2fs12877-022-02918-7&partnerID=40&md5=43e1f797641704264d9f1ff1b2de6060,"Aged; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Female; Humans; Male; Physical Examination; Psychometrics; Reproducibility of Results; Surveys and Questionnaires; aged; factor analysis; female; human; male; physical examination; psychometry; questionnaire; reproducibility",Adaptation; Factor analysis; Measurement; Rasch analysis; Reliability; Validity,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85126729059,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,200,0,1,0,0,76.4(6.6),Successful Aging ,
8,10.1007/s11357-022-00688-z,"Carotid disease, cognition, and aging: time to redefine asymptomatic disease?","There is an increasing appreciation of the vascular contributions in the development of age-related cognitive impairment and dementia1,2. Identifying risk and maintaining cognitive health for successful aging is ever relevant in our aging population. Carotid disease, a well-established risk factor for stroke and often a harbinger of other vascular disease states, is also emerging as another vascular risk factor for age-related cognitive decline. When combined with vascular risk factors, the incidence of age-related carotid disease can be as high as 70%3,4. Historically, carotid disease has been dichotomized into two large groups in trial design, outcome measurements, and treatment decisions: symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis. The dichotomous distinction between asymptomatic and symptomatic carotid stenosis based on existing definitions may be limiting the care we are able to provide for patients classified as �asymptomatic� from their carotid disease. Medically, we now know that these patients should be treated with the same intensive medical therapy as those with �symptomatic� carotid disease. Emerging data also shows that hypoperfusion from asymptomatic disease may lead to significant cognitive impairment in the aging population, and it is plausible that most �age-related� cognitive changes may be reflective of vascular impairment and neurovascular dysfunction. While over the past 30�years medical, surgical, and radiological advances have pushed the field of neurovascular disease to significantly reduce the number of ischemic strokes, we are far from any meaningful interventions to prevent vascular cognitive impairment. In addition to including cognitive outcome measures, future studies of carotid disease will also benefit from including advanced neuroimaging modalities not currently utilized in standard clinical imaging protocols, such as perfusion imaging and/or functional connectivity mapping, which may provide novel data to better assess for hypoxic-ischemic changes and neurovascular dysfunction across diffuse cognitive networks. While current recommendations advise against widespread population screening for asymptomatic carotid stenosis, emerging evidence linking carotid stenosis to cognitive impairment prompts us to re-consider our approach for older patients with vascular risk factors who are at risk for cognitive decline. � 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to American Aging Association.",Lineback C.M.; Stamm B.; Sorond F.; Caprio F.Z.,"Lineback, Christina M.

9,10.1002/cphy.c220012,Aging and Bone Metabolism,"Changes in bone architecture and metabolism with aging increase the likelihood of osteoporosis and fracture. Age-onset osteoporosis is multifactorial, with contributory extrinsic and intrinsic factors including certain medical problems, specific prescription drugs, estrogen loss, secondary hyperparathyroidism, microenvironmental and cellular alterations in bone tissue, and mechanical unloading or immobilization. At the histological level, there are changes in trabecular and cortical bone as well as marrow cellularity, lineage switching of mesenchymal stem cells to an adipogenic fate, inadequate transduction of signals during skeletal loading, and predisposition toward senescent cell accumulation with production of a senescence-associated secretory phenotype. Cumulatively, these changes result in bone remodeling abnormalities that over time cause net bone loss typically seen in older adults. Age-related osteoporosis is a geriatric syndrome due to the multiple etiologies that converge upon the skeleton to produce the ultimate phenotypic changes that manifest as bone fragility. Bone tissue is dynamic but with tendencies toward poor osteoblastic bone formation and relative osteoclastic bone resorption with aging. Interactions with other aging physiologic systems, such as muscle, may also confer detrimental effects on the aging skeleton. Conversely, individuals who maintain their BMD experience a lower risk of fractures, disability, and mortality, suggesting that this phenotype may be a marker of successful aging. � 2023 American Physiological Society.

Recent PA research has focused on health benefits associated with work and volunteering, respectively. However, these activities are often assumed to have independent associations with health and wellbeing. Less clear is whether and in what ways older adults participate in productive engagement lifestyles including multiple activities over a long period of time. This paper uses latent class analyses and the Health and Retirement Study to examine combined engagement in work and volunteer activities over 12�years between ages 56-68 to (1) identify patterns of work and volunteer activities across the retirement transition, (2) evaluate characteristics of individuals within these patterns, and (3) explore whether particular patterns are associated with markers of health and wellbeing. We describe how our findings inform successful aging by incentivizing socially and individually beneficial PA lifestyles. � The Author(s) 2022.",Carr D.C.; Kail B.L.; Taylor M.,"Carr, Dawn C.

11,10.3390/ijms231810359,The Role of PEDF in Reproductive Aging of the Ovary �,"Reproductive aging is characterized by a decline in ovarian function and in oocytes� quantity and quality. Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), a pivotal player in ovarian angiogenic and oxidative balance, was evaluated for its involvement in reproductive aging. Our work examines the initial stage of reproductive aging in women and mice, and the involvement of PEDF in the process. Granulosa cells from reproductively-aged (RA) women and mice (36�44 years old and 9�10 months old, respectively) indicated an increase in the level of PEDF mRNA (qPCR), with yet unchanged levels of AMH and FSHR mRNAs. However, the PEDF protein level in individual women showed an intra-cellular decrease (ELISA), along with a decrease in the corresponding follicular fluid, which reflects the secreted fraction of the protein. The in vitro maturation (IVM) rate in the oocytes of RA mice was lower compared with the oocytes of young mice, demonstrated by a reduced polar body extrusion (PBE) rate. The supplementation of PEDF improved the hampered PBE rate, manifested by a higher number of energetically-competent oocytes (ATP concentration and mtDNA copy number of individual oocytes). Our findings propose PEDF as an early marker of reproductive aging, and a possible therapeutic in vitro agent that could enhance the number of good-quality oocytes in older IVF patients. � 2022 by the authors.",Nemerovsky L.; Bar-Joseph H.; Eldar-Boock A.; Tarabeih R.; Elmechaly C.; Ben-Ami I.; Shalgi R.,"Nemerovsky, Luba (57194242739); Bar-Joseph, Hadas (35781673800); Eldar-Boock, Anat (36633893000); Tarabeih, Rana (57896803100); Elmechaly, Cindy (57897042800); Ben-Ami, Ido (9740664800); Shalgi, Ruth (7005394644)",57194242739; 35781673800; 36633893000; 57896803100; 57897042800; 9740664800; 7005394644,2022,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,23,18,10359,,,,0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138323382&doi=10.3390%2fijms231810359&partnerID=40&md5=8d94a501a423cc8bd9f7e5c4babe6f02,"Adenosine Triphosphate; Aging; Animals; DNA, Mitochondrial; Eye Proteins; Female; Humans; Mice; Nerve Growth Factors; Oocytes; Ovary; RNA, Messenger; Serpins; adenosine triphosphate; messenger RNA; mitochondrial DNA; pigment epithelium derived factor; adenosine triphosphate; eye protein; messenger RNA; mitochondrial DNA; nerve growth factor; pigment epithelium-derived factor; serine proteinase inhibitor; adult; aging; animal cell; animal experiment; Article; controlled study; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; granulosa cell; human; human cell; in vitro study; mouse; nonhuman; oocyte; oocyte maturation; ovary follicle fluid; polar body; protein expression; aging; animal; genetics; metabolism; oocyte; ovary",granulosa cells; oocyte maturation; PEDF; reproductive aging,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85138323382,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,36-44,Reproductive Aging,

This pilot program consisted of trained volunteers who provided supportive, weekly calls as well as community resources with their Caring Callers clients. The purpose of this study was to qualitatively explore the experiences of Senior Companion volunteers in the Caring Callers Program through the lens of productive aging. We completed semi-structured interviews with 18 Caring Callers volunteers. We used Rapid and Rigorous Qualitative Date Analysis (RADaR) which yielded four themes: (1) reciprocity; (2) purposeful use of time; (3) learning new skills; and (4) gaining perspective. Our findings provide insight for gerontological researchers examining volunteering as a productive aging activity and offer strategies for designing peer-led, telephone-based interventions to promote social connectedness in an unprecedented time. � The Author(s) 2022.",Fields N.L.; Lee K.; Cassidy J.; Kunz-Lomelin A.; Stringfellow M.K.; Feinhals G.,"Fields, Noelle L.

13,10.1093/humrep/deac178,Markers of ovarian reserve are associated with reproductive age acceleration in granulosa cells from IVF patients,"STUDY QUESTION: Is reproductive aging in granulosa cells associated with markers of ovarian reserve? SUMMARY ANSWER: Age acceleration was associated with anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) levels, antral follicle count (AFC), oocyte yield and maturity, and the number of successfully fertilized embryos. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: The rate of reproductive aging varies among women of the same age. DNA methylation can be used to predict epigenetic age in a variety of tissues. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This was a cross-sectional study of 70 women at the time of oocyte retrieval. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The 70 participants were recruited for this study at an academic medical center and they provided follicular fluid samples at the time of oocyte retrieval. Granulosa cells were isolated and assessed on the MethylationEPIC array. Linear regression was used to evaluate the associations between DNA methylation-based age predictions from granulosa cells and chronological age. Age acceleration was calculated as the residual of regressing DNA methylation-based age on chronological age. Linear regressions were used to determine the associations between age acceleration and markers of ovarian reserve and IVF cycle outcomes. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Participants were a mean of 36.7?�?3.9?years old. In regards to race, 54% were white, 19% were African American and 27% were of another background. Age acceleration was normally distributed and not associated with chronological age. Age acceleration was negatively associated with AMH levels (t?=?-3.1, P?=?0.003) and AFC (t?=?-4.0, P?=?0.0001), such that women with a higher age acceleration had a lower ovarian reserve. Age acceleration was also negatively correlated with the total number of oocytes retrieved (t?=?-3.9, P?=?0.0002), the number of mature oocytes (t?=?-3.8, P?=?0.0003) and the number of fertilized oocytes or two-pronuclear oocytes (t?=?-2.8, P?=?0.008) in the main analysis. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: This study used pooled follicular fluid, which does not allow for the investigation of individual follicles. Infertility patients may also be different from the general population, but, as we used granulosa cells, the participants had to be from an IVF population. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: This study demonstrated that epigenetic age and age acceleration can be calculated from granulosa cells collected at the time of oocyte retrieval. GrimAge most strongly predicted chronological age, and GrimAge acceleration was associated with baseline and cycle characteristics as well as cycle outcomes, which indicates its potential clinical relevance in evaluating both oocyte quantity and quality.

14,10.3390/ani13030369,The Effect of a Synthetic Scent on Cheetah Behaviour,"In cheetahs, age at first parturition correlates negatively with reproductive lifespan (asymmetric reproductive aging); therefore, breeding cheetahs at a young age is essential to maximize reproductive performance in this species. However, younger females display a significantly reduced frequency of copulatory behaviour, which negatively affects breeding. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are known to regulate appropriate behavioural responses in various species, including reproductive behaviour; moreover, they have proven to play a role in captive breeding methods in cheetahs, as well as mate choice. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of a synthetic scent (SS) on the frequency of the five oestrous behaviour(s) (sniff, rub, roll, spray, and meow-chirp) known to be indicative of oestrus in female cheetahs. Based on the results of a previous study from our research group, five VOCs, identified in the marking fluid of male cheetahs, and known to be pheromones involved in reproductive behaviour, were used to create the SS. This was accomplished by mixing benzaldehyde, acetophenone, indole, dimethyl disulphide and phenol with (99.9%) ethanol. Seven female cheetahs were then observed for one oestrus cycle without stimulation (control) and then once again while exposed to the SS (treatment), which was sprayed on foil trays placed around the outside of each enclosure. The occurrence of the five oestrous behaviours was recorded and tallied per day of observations. Although the SS did not have a significant effect on the frequency of oestrous behaviours displayed by the females used in this study, five of the seven (71%) did show an increase in their behaviour with the SS when oestrogen concentrations were at their highest (peak oestrus), including three of the four younger females. The SS also significantly increased the sniffing behaviour in general. Although the results of this study do indicate that VOCs influence cheetahs and their behaviour, firm conclusions cannot be drawn due to the low number of animals used, as well as the significant effect the observation methods had on the results. Nonetheless, this study represents the first of this kind in cheetahs, therefore representing an important step in determining the role of VOCs in aiding breeding in captivity. � 2023 by the authors.",Tommasi A.; Tredoux A.G.J.; Koziel J.A.; Esposito G.,"Tommasi, Alexia (57320498000); Tredoux, Andreas G.

The implication of female germline aging is profound from the perspective of evolutionary conservation of the aging mechanism, a topic of continuous and widespread interest that has yet to be fully addressed for the mammalian oocyte. There is a certain need to develop novel antiaging strategies to delay or slow down aging, or even to reverse the aging phenotype in the oocyte. In the past two decades, several antioxidants have been tested for this purpose. Resveratrol is one of these latter-mentioned compounds, which has shown anti-inflammatory and antiaging properties in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, resveratrol appears to enhance the activity of so-called Sirtuin 1, too. Therefore, the aim of this review is to summarize and discuss the latest findings related to resveratrol, Sirtuin 1, and their crosstalk and influence on the mammalian oocyte to elucidate the question of whether these factors can delay or slow down reproductive aging. � 2022 by the authors.",Grzeczka A.; Kordowitzki P.,"Grzeczka, Arkadiusz (57398043200); Kordowitzki, Pawe?

16,10.1371/journal.pgen.1010282,Aging and sperm signals alter DNA break formation and repair in the C. elegans germline,"Female reproductive aging is associated with decreased oocyte quality and fertility. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a powerful system for understanding the biology of aging and exhibits age-related reproductive defects that are analogous to those observed in many mammals, including dysregulation of DNA repair. C. elegans germline function is influenced simultaneously by both reproductive aging and signals triggered by limited supplies of sperm, which are depleted over chronological time. To delineate the causes of DNA repair defects in aged C. elegans germlines, we assessed both DNA double strand break (DSB) induction and repair during meiotic prophase I progression in aged germlines which were depleted of self-sperm, mated, or never exposed to sperm. We find that germline DSB induction is dramatically reduced only in hermaphrodites which have exhausted their endogenous sperm, suggesting that a signal due specifically to sperm depletion downregulates DSB formation. We also find that DSB repair is delayed in aged germlines regardless of whether hermaphrodites had either a reduction in sperm supply or an inability to endogenously produce sperm. These results demonstrate that in contrast to DSB induction, DSB repair defects are a feature of C. elegans reproductive aging independent of sperm presence. Finally, we demonstrate that the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme variant UEV-2 is required for efficient DSB repair specifically in young germlines, implicating UEV-2 in the regulation of DNA repair during reproductive aging. In summary, our study demonstrates that DNA repair defects are a feature of C. elegans reproductive aging and uncovers parallel mechanisms regulating efficient DSB formation in the germline.

17,10.1055/a-1542-8992,The Influence of Turmeric and Curcumin on Female Reproductive Processes,"The present review summarizes the available knowledge concerning the action of curcumin, the best-known polyphenol among the rhizomes of Curcumas, on female reproductive processes and their dysfunctions. Curcumin affects a number of physiological processes, including female reproduction (puberty, reproductive aging, ovarian follicullogenesis and oogenesis, and fecundity). Curcumin can affect these processes via changes in the release and reception of pituitary and ovarian hormones, growth factors and cytokines. Furthermore, it can influence the response of ovarian cells to these substances and external environmental factors. Finally, curcumin can affect oxidative processes within the ovary and numerous intracellular signalling pathways related to ovarian cell proliferation and apoptosis.

Methods Participants (N = 2,406) aged 35 to 55 years completed the Women Living Better Survey online between March to August 2020, and 1,529 met the inclusion criteria and provided menstrual cycle data for staging reproductive aging. They were recruited from the Women Living Better newsletter and from other online groups of midlife women. Hierarchical regression analysis using a two-stage model tested the effect of several factors on each of five bothersome symptom groups: brain fog, volatile mood, fatigue/pain, vasomotor/sleep disruption, and anxiety/vigilance symptoms. In stage I, personal characteristics, reproductive aging stage, and health behaviors were examined, and in stage II roles (ie, caregiver, partner, employment-related), satisfaction with life roles and stressors associated with roles were added. Results More bothersome brain fog symptoms were associated with less education, MT (vs late reproductive stage), low satisfaction with life roles, and greater health-related and overcommitment stress (all P < 0.005). More bothersome volatile mood symptoms were associated with health-related, partner relationship, and other relationship stress. More bothersome fatigue/pain symptoms were associated with less education and greater difficulty paying for basics and health-related and other relationship stress. Vasomotor/sleep-onset symptoms were associated with less education, MT, and health-related and work stress. More bothersome anxiety/vigilance symptoms were associated with less education, more difficulty paying for basics, and health and work stress. Conclusions Recognizing that midlife stress comes from many role- and relationship-related sources and that several of these stressors are associated with greater symptom bother supports the importance of proactive identification and management of sources of stress.  � Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

As women delay childbearing, understanding the mechanisms of ovarian aging and follicular depletion have become increasingly more relevant. Age-related meiotic errors in oocytes are well established. In addition, it is also important to understand how intraovarian regulators change with aging and how certain treatments can mitigate the impact of aging. Individual studies have demonstrated that reproductive pathways involving antimullerian hormone (AMH), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), neurotropins, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), and mitochondrial function are pivotal for healthy oocyte and cumulus cell development and are altered with increasing age. We provide a comprehensive review of these individual studies and explain how these factors change in oocytes, cumulus cells, and follicular fluid. We also summarize how modifiers of folliculogenesis, such as vitamin D, coenzyme Q, and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) may be used to potentially overcome age-related changes and enhance fertility outcomes of aged follicles, as evidenced by human and rodent studies. � 2022, The Author(s).",Esencan E.; Beroukhim G.; Seifer D.B.,"Esencan, Ecem (57193501657); Beroukhim, Gabriela (57206781873); Seifer, David B.

Two Case Studies of the Garden City Initiative in Taipei,"In discussions on urban food security and healthy aging, urban agriculture is described in the context of changing approaches to sustainable urban development under crises. Space planning-related urban agriculture practices, such as edible landscaping combing design and small-scale crop production, are the primary active strategies and environmental policy tools. This paper addresses urban food security and health aging by practicing campus agriculture and community gardens around National Taiwan University. In particular, this study adopts participatory action research, participatory observation, and semi-structured, in-depth interviews as the research method. We examined the challenges and benefits of implementing urban agriculture in Taipei. Further, we proposed that urban agricultural space building and planning based on a social support network of urban agriculture can effectively address food supply and healthy aging for an aging urban society to some extent. � 2022 by the authors.",Zhou Y.; Wei C.; Zhou Y.,"Zhou, Yan (58076377900); Wei, Chunjui (58077194500); Zhou, Yong (57212491806)",58076377900; 58077194500; 57212491806,2023,Land,12,1,55,,,,0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146754774&doi=10.3390%2fland12010055&partnerID=40&md5=a73db0ca8ab1cd26bffbc4f0b59ced0b,,campus garden; community garden; health aging; spatial building and planning; urban agriculture,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85146754774,1,0,0,Taipei,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,NA,Healthy Aging,
21,10.3390/ijerph191711050,The Impact of Training on the Loss of Cardiorespiratory Fitness in Aging Masters Endurance Athletes,"Elite masters endurance athletes are considered models of optimal healthy aging due to the maintenance of high cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) until old age. Whereas a drop in VO2max in masters athletes has been broadly investigated, the modifying impact of training still remains a matter of debate. Longitudinal observations in masters endurance athletes demonstrated VO2max declines between ?5% and ?46% per decade that were closely related to changes in training volume. Here, using regression analyses, we show that 54% and 39% of the variance in observed VO2max decline in male and female athletes, respectively is explained by changes in training volume. An almost linear VO2max decrease was observed in studies on young and older athletes, as well as non-athletes, starting a few days after training cessation, with a decline of as much as ?20% after 12 weeks. Besides a decline in stroke volume and cardiac output, training cessation was accompanied by considerable reductions in citrate synthase and succinate dehydrogenase activity (reduction in mitochondrial content and oxidative capacity). This reduction could largely be rescued within similar time periods of training (re)uptake. It is evident that training reduction or cessation leads to a considerably accelerated VO2max drop, as compared to the gradual aging-related VO2max decline, which can rapidly nullify many of the benefits of preceding long-term training efforts. � 2022 by the authors.",Burtscher J.; Strasser B.; Burtscher M.; Millet G.P.,"Burtscher, Johannes (6701428032); Strasser, Barbara (10144543900); Burtscher, Martin (24068774300); Millet, Gregoire P.

22,10.1111/nuf.12843,Social integration: A concept analysis,"Background: In recent decades, social isolation has been increasingly linked to serious health conditions. However, social integration (SI) is a complex concept that has not been systematically explored or defined in nursing. It is essential for nurses and healthcare providers to have a clearer concept of SI to better provide holistic care to support optimal health. Purpose: This concept analysis aimed to clarify the concept of SI in health research and to identify attributes, antecedents, and consequences of the concept of SI to enhance understanding of the concept and its implications for human health. Methods: Walker and Avant's framework was used as the methodology for the concept analysis of SI. A literature search using PubMed, CINAHL, and Embase databases on SI was conducted with keywords: �integration,��social integration,� �social relationships,� �social participation,� �community integration,� �socialization.�Studies included in the search were published from 2001 to 2021. Results: SI is affected by multidimensional individual, societal, and environmental factors. Defining attributes are productive activities, social relationships, community engagement, and leisure activities. SI is effective in promoting multiple aspects of health as well as healthy aging and overall well-being. Conclusion: The analysis contributes to a comprehensive and fundamental understanding of SI and contributes to helping nurses better understand patients' circumstances that promote or inhibit SI. This knowledge will support the development of interventions that support optimal health and well-being, in assisting patients to remain integrated or reintegrate into society during and following an illness or injury. � 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",Jung W.; Thompson H.J.; Byun E.,"Jung, Wonkyung (57261785900); Thompson, Hilaire J.

Methods: The sample comprised 112 healthy persons (M = 68.80, SD = 7.99) aged 48�89 who were split into six age groups (< 60, 60�64, 65�69, 70�74, 75�79, and ? 80). Fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation and ReHo analyses were performed and were compared among the six age groups, and the significant results commonly found across groups were correlated with the gray matter volume of the areas and the age variable. Results: Increased activity was found using fALFF in the superior temporal gyrus and inferior frontal gyrus when comparing the first group and the fifth. Regarding ReHo analysis, Group 6 showed increased ReHo in the temporal lobe (hippocampus), right and left precuneus, right caudate, and right and left thalamus depending on the age group. Moreover, significant correlations between age and fALFF and ReHo clusters, as well as with their gray matter volume were found, meaning that the higher the age, the higher the regional synchronization, the lower the fALFF activation, and the lower gray matter of the right thalamus. Conclusion: Both techniques have been shown to be valuable and usable tools for disentangling brain changes in activation in a very low interval of years in healthy aging.

The age-related increase of myosteatosis is an important characteristic of sarcopenia and contributes to fragility. Aims: To investigate the impact of healthy aging on intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT) and muscle fat fraction (FF) in the thigh and the paraspinal muscles in males. Methods: In 54 healthy males (age 20�70), all active hobby golfers, magnetic resonance imaging was performed to determine volume of IMAT, volume of muscle tissue (MT) and of percentage of FF. Results: Between ages 20�70, at the thigh, IMAT/MT volume and MT FF increased annually by 2.9% and 1.3%, respectively. At the psoas IMAT/Psoas volume did not change with age. MT FF increased by 1.5% annually. At the erector spinae IMAT/Erector volume decreased by 0.3% and MT FF increased by 2.8% annually. Discussion: With increasing age, in males, thigh muscle atrophied, muscle tissue was partly replaced by adipose tissue and remaining muscle tissue also contained more fat. Similar effects were observed in the erector spinae. The psoas muscle did not atrophy, although MT FF also increased with age. Overall correlations with age were weak to moderate with higher correlations observed in the paraspinal muscles. Conclusions: Age-related increases of muscle fat infiltration were observed in the thigh and in the spine. Muscle atrophy did not occur in the psoas. In cross-sectional studies, an adjustment of volumetric parameters by muscle volume is advisable when comparing age-dependent results. � 2022, The Author(s).",Engelke K.; Ghasemikaram M.; Chaudry O.; Uder M.; Nagel A.M.; Jakob F.; Kemmler W.,"Engelke, Klaus (7005665602); Ghasemikaram, Mansour (55987242500); Chaudry, Oliver (57194210868); Uder, Michael (7003907613); Nagel, Armin M.

However, nursing home residents with body mass index (BMI) below 18.5 kg/m2 and above 25.0 kg/m2 have been understudied. We examined the prevalence of multi-morbidity and disability in activities of daily living (ADL) by BMI category and further investigated the association between BMI, multi-morbidity, and disability of ADL in a large cohort of older adults in nursing homes in New Zealand. Methods: A retrospective review of nursing home residents� data obtained from the New Zealand International Resident Assessment Instrument national dataset from 2015 to 2018. One hundred ninety-eight thousand seven hundred ninety older adults (?60 years) living in nursing homes were included. BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms (kg) divided by height in meters squared (m2). Multimorbidity was defined as the presence of ?2 health conditions. The risk of disability was measured by a 4-item ADL self-performance scale. The prevalence ratio (PR) of the association between BMI and multi-morbidity and between BMI and disability in ADL was assessed using Poisson regression with robust variance. Results: Of the 198,790 residents, 10.6, 26.6, 11.3 and 5.4% were underweight, overweight, obese, and extremely obese, respectively. 26.4, 31.3 and 21.3% had one, two and three disease conditions, respectively, while 14.3% had four or more conditions. 24.1% could perform only one ADL, and 16.1% could perform none. The prevalence of multi-morbidity increased with increasing BMI, whereas mean disability in ADL decreased with increasing BMI. The risk of multi-morbidity was higher for the overweight (PR, 95%CI: 1.03, 1.02�1.03) and obese (PR, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.06�1.08) compared to normal weight after controlling for age, sex, ethnicity, and region. BMI was inversely associated with mean ADL; ?, 95% CI for overweight (? 0.30, ? 0.32, ? 0.28) and obese ? 0.43, ? 0.45, ? 0.40 compared to normal weight. Conclusion: Being underweight was associated with a decline in the performance of ADL in nursing home residents. In contrast, being overweight and obese positively affected functional performance, demonstrating that the obesity paradox plays an important role in this population.

However, age-associated coordination patterns of morphological networks and cognitive variation are not well understood. Purpose: To investigate the age-related differences of cortical topology in morphological brain networks from multiple perspectives. Study Type: Prospective, observational multisite study. Population: A total of 1427 healthy participants (59.1% female, 51.75 � 19.82 years old) from public datasets. Field Strength/Sequence: 1.5 T/3�T, T1-weighted magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo (MP-RAGE) sequence. Assessment: The multimodal parcellation atlas was used to define regions of interest (ROIs). The Jensen-Shannon divergence-based individual morphological networks were constructed by estimating the interregional similarity of cortical thickness distribution. Graph-theory based global network properties were then calculated, followed by ROI analysis (including global/nodal topological analysis and hub analysis) with statistical tests. Statistical Tests: Chi-square test, Jensen�Shannon divergence-based similarity measurement, general linear model with false discovery rate correction. Significance was set at P < 0.05. Results: The clustering coefficient (q�=�0.016), global efficiency (q�=�0.007), and small-worldness (q�=�0.006) were significantly negatively quadratic correlated with age. The group-level hubs of seven age groups were found mainly distributed in default mode network, visual network, salient network, and somatosensory motor network (the sum of these hubs' distribution in each group exceeds 55%). Further ROI-wise analysis showed significant nodal trajectories of intramodular connectivities. Data Conclusion: These results demonstrated the age-associated reconfiguration of morphological networks. Specifically, network segregation/integration had an inverted U-shaped relationship with age, which indicated age-related differences in transmission efficiency. Evidence Level: 2.

27,10.1093/gerona/glac065,Optimizing Translational Research for Exceptional Health and Life Span: A Systematic Narrative of Studies to Identify Translatable Therapeutic Target(s) for Exceptional Health Span in Humans,"BACKGROUND: Exceptional longevity as manifested by the lower incidence and delayed onset of age-related disabilities/diseases that include cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's disease, cancer is believed to be influenced by inherent protective molecular factors in exceptionally long-lived individuals. Unraveling these protective factors could lead to the discovery of therapeutic target(s) and interventions to promote healthy aging. METHODS: In this context, the National Institute on Aging has established a collection of translational longevity research projects (ie, the Long-Life Family Study, the Longevity Consortium, Longevity Genomics, and the Integrative Longevity Omics) which are generating large omics data sets spanning the human genome to phenome and have embarked on cross-species multiomic data analyses integrating human and nonhuman species that display wide variation in their life spans. RESULTS: It is expected that these studies will discover key signaling pathways that influence exceptional health span and identify therapeutic targets for translation to enhance health and life span. Other efforts related to translational longevity research include the ""Comprehensive Evaluation of Aging-Related Clinical Outcomes and Geroproteins study,"" which focuses on potential effects in humans of polypeptides/proteins whose circulating levels change with age, and for which experimental evidence indicates reversal or acceleration of aging changes. The ""Predictive Human Mechanistic Markers Network"" is devoted to the development of predictive markers of aging, for target engagement when testing novel interventions for healthy aging. CONCLUSION: We describe here the significance, the unique study design, categories of data sets, analytical strategies, and a data portal to facilitate open science and sharing of resources from these longevity studies to identify and validate potential therapeutic targets for healthy aging.

28,10.3390/nu14193910,Adherence to Mediterranean Diet and Soluble Klotho Level: The Value of Food Synergy in Aging,"Diets for healthy aging have long been an intriguing issue. The current study makes a head-to-head comparison of four dietary patterns and their associations with soluble Klotho (s-Klotho) levels, an aging-related marker. The dietary data of 7906 subjects were obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2007�2016. Each participant was given a score or was grouped according to four dietary patterns, namely the Mediterranean adherence diet score (MDS), the low-carbohydrate-diet score, a low-fat diet, and a low-carbohydrate diet. Subsequently, the associations with s-Klotho were examined using linear regression analyses. In addition, we calculated the odds ratio (OR) for aging in different dietary patterns, taking the lowest quartile of s-Klotho as a reference for aging. The MDS was the only dietary pattern that revealed a relationship with s-Klotho levels. The positive association (? coefficient: 9.41, p < 0.001) remained significant when dividing the MDS into tertiles (Tertile 2: ? coefficient: 36.87, p < 0.001; Tertile 3: ? coefficient: 45.92, p < 0.001) and grouping participants into subsets by sex, age, and BMI. A lower OR for aging was observed in higher MDS groups (Tertile 2: OR = 0.86, p = 0.026; Tertile 3: OR = 0.77, p < 0.001). However, when analyzed separately, merely three out of nine components of the MDS, namely alcohol consumption (? coefficient: 42.54, p < 0.001), fruit (? coefficient: 11.59, p = 0.029), and dairy products (? coefficient: 8.55, p = 0.032), showed a significant association with s-Klotho. The Mediterranean diet adopts a food-based approach, which has the merit of valuing the complex interactions between foods and their constituents, and further brings benefits to healthy aging. � 2022 by the authors.",Wu S.-E.; Chen Y.-J.; Chen W.-L.,"Wu, Shou-En (57218921164); Chen, Ying-Jen (57926333800); Chen, Wei-Liang (36039670300)",57218921164; 57926333800; 36039670300,2022,Nutrients,14,19,3910,,,,1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139741723&doi=10.3390%2fnu14193910&partnerID=40&md5=4b28477666d49d9c1ce08e53887c3602,"Aging; Carbohydrates; Diet, Mediterranean; Fruit; Humans; Nutrition Surveys; klotho protein; carbohydrate; adult; aging; alcohol consumption; Article; body mass; controlled study; dairy product; dietary pattern; female; fruit; gene expression; healthy aging; human; linear regression analysis; low carbohydrate diet; low fat diet; major clinical study; male; Mediterranean diet; public health; aging; nutrition",aging; low-carbohydrate diet; low-fat diet; Mediterranean diet; soluble Klotho,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85139741723,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,7906,0,1,0,0,NA,Healthy Aging,
29,10.1080/15548627.2022.2078069,"Distinct designer diamines promote mitophagy, and thereby enhance healthspan in C. elegans and protect human cells against oxidative damage","Impaired mitophagy is a primary pathogenic event underlying diverse aging-associated diseases such as Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases and sarcopenia. Therefore, augmentation of mitophagy, the process by which defective mitochondria are removed, then replaced by new ones, is an emerging strategy for preventing the evolvement of multiple morbidities in the elderly population. Based on the scaffold of spermidine (Spd), a known mitophagy-promoting agent, we designed and tested a family of structurally related compounds. A prototypic member, 1,8-diaminooctane (VL-004), exceeds Spd in its ability to induce mitophagy and protect against oxidative stress. VL-004 activity is mediated by canonical aging genes and promotes lifespan and healthspan in C. elegans. Moreover, it enhances mitophagy and protects against oxidative injury in rodent and human cells. Initial structural characterization suggests simple rules for the design of compounds with improved bioactivity, opening the way for a new generation of agents with a potential to promote healthy aging. � 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Srivastava V.; Zelmanovich V.; Shukla V.; Abergel R.; Cohen I.; Ben-Sasson S.A.; Gross E.,"Srivastava, Vijigisha (57728820200); Zelmanovich, Veronica (56442671200); Shukla, Virendra (55386896000); Abergel, Rachel (57192808431); Cohen, Irit (57728930000); Ben-Sasson, Shmuel A.

30,10.3389/fpubh.2022.967170,Can leisure and entertainment lifestyle promote health among older people living alone in China?�A simultaneous equation approach,"Objectives: With the surging number of older people living alone, their lifestyles and health status have aroused increasing concern. This study aims to investigate whether a leisure and entertainment lifestyle (LEL) can improve the multidimensional health among older people living alone and try to identify the latent mechanisms among them. Method: For this purpose, we extracted data from the Chinese General Social Survey (CGSS) and established a simultaneous equations model, comprising ordinary least square regression (OLS), two-stage least squares (2SLS), and the mediating effect model. Results: Older people living alone in China reported relatively better mental health status (3.64 � 1.07), followed by physical health (3.41 � 1.26) and social health (2.75 � 1.18). In the OLS model, LEL significantly improved the social health of older people living alone (? = 0.054, P < 0.01), followed by physical health (? = 0.042, P < 0.01) and mental health (? = 0.027, P < 0.01). After endogenous tests from 2SLS model and robustness tests, we found that more active LEL was associated with higher levels of physical health and mental health. However, LEL had no significant effect on the improvement of the social health of the older people living alone. Using the mediation analysis, exercise efficacy partially mediated the relationship of LEL with physical health and mental health, and the ratios were 19.75 and 24.85%, respectively. Similarly, positive life attitudes partially mediated the relationship between LEL and physical health, and LEL and mental health, with ratios of 10.65 and 26.83%, respectively. Conclusion: Our findings suggested that LEL is significantly associated with better physical and mental health for older people living alone in China, and the association is mediated by exercise efficacy and positive attitudes toward life. Promoting more leisure and recreational activities, upgrading exercise efficacy, and encouraging positive life attitudes are necessary health promotion measures in active aging policies for the wellbeing of older people living alone.

While adherence to physical activity programs has traditionally been low in older people, immersive virtual reality (IVR) could provide an alternative and complementary training mode. A randomized clinical trial was conducted to explore the feasibility and effects of a 10-week IVR exergame program on physical functions of 24 institutionalized older adults who were allocated to an experimental group (EG n = 13; 85.08 � 8.48 years) and control group (CG n = 11; 84.82 � 8.10 years). The IVR intervention was feasible, with no adverse effects being reported (no Simulator Sickness Questionnaire symptoms; low negative experience scores on the Game Experience Questionnaire < 0.34/4), no dropouts, high adherence, and good post-gaming usability (System Usability Scale > 73.96%). The EG showed significant improvements: Tinetti scores for balance (1.84 � 1.06; p < 0.001), gait (1.00 � 1.08; p < 0.001), total score (2.84 � 1.67; p < 0.001), and handgrip (4.96 � 4.22; p < 0.001) (pre�post assessment). The CG showed significantly worsened compared to the EG: Five times sit-to-stand test, Tinetti scores for balance, gait, and total score, and the Timed Up and Go test total score (post-assessment). The findings show that the IVR intervention is a feasible method to approach a personalized exercise program and an effective way by which to improve physical function in the target population. � 2022 by the authors.",Campo-Prieto P.; Cancela-Carral J.M.; Rodr�guez-Fuentes G.,"Campo-Prieto, Pablo (57204685076); Cancela-Carral, Jos� M� (57220841363); Rodr�guez-Fuentes, Gustavo (18635226700)",57204685076; 57220841363; 18635226700,2022,Sensors,22,18,6742,,,,0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138376666&doi=10.3390%2fs22186742&partnerID=40&md5=58c50df482e03a05e903ed9be942106a,Aged; Exercise Therapy; Exergaming; Feasibility Studies; Hand Strength; Humans; Postural Balance; Time and Motion Studies; Virtual Reality; Health; Medical applications; Virtual reality; Aged 80 and overs; Digital health; Exercise; Game for healths; Immersive virtual reality; Older adults; Personalized medicines; Physical function; Video-games; Virtual reality exposure therapies; aged; body equilibrium; controlled study; feasibility study; hand strength; human; kinesiotherapy; procedures; randomized controlled trial; task performance; virtual reality; Surveys,aged 80 and over; digital health; exercise; games for health; older adults; personalized medicine; physical functions; rehabilitation; videogames; virtual reality exposure therapy,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85138376666,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,24,0,0,0,0,NA,Active Aging,

Social participation is essential for active aging. The health status of spouses is intertwined with the trajectory of the social function of the elderly. Objectives: This study examined the association between spouse health and social participation among older Chinese adults. The study also explored the mediating role of loneliness and anxiety between spousal health and social participation. Methods: The analytic sample included 6125 adults aged 60 years and above. Prospective data were obtained from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS). First, we described basic socio-demographic information about the sample. Secondly, Spearman's correlation analysis was used to determine whether correlations existed between spousal health, loneliness, anxiety, and social participation. Finally, mediation analysis was run using the SPSS macro PROCESS program. Results: Spousal health, loneliness, anxiety, and social participation were significantly correlated (P < 0.01). Spousal health could not only have a direct positive impact on social participation in older adults (? = 0.239, 95 % CI: 0.120, 0.359), but also indirectly on social participation through three pathways: an independent mediating effect of loneliness (? = 0.020, 95 % CI: 0.009, 0.034), an independent mediating effect of anxiety (? = 0.018, 95%CI: 0.009, 0.032), and a chain mediating effect of loneliness and anxiety (? = 0.004, 95%CI: 0.002, 0.007).

Methods A survey, using convenience sampling method, involving 452 community older adults in 9 districts in urban areas of Chongqing, was conducted by the General questionnaire and Smart Elderly Care Needs questionnaire from October to December, 2021. And analyze the influencing factors of the demand for smart elderly care needs. Results In the demand for smart elderly care needs of the community elderly in the main urban area of Chongqing, the scores of needs for daily life care, social and emotional support, daily medical care and emergency medical assistance were 3.39 � 1.45, 3.60 � 1.28, 3.80 � 1.19 and 3.87 � 1.27, respectively. The results of ordinal Logistic analysis showed that gender, age, living alone and education level were the influencing factors of daily life care needs(P<0.05). Age and living alone were the influencing factors of social and emotional support and emergency medical assistance needs(P?0.05). Daily medical care needs were influenced by living alone(P?0.05). Conclusions Community older adults in main urban areas of Chongqing have high level of needs for smart elderly care. Smart elderly care should focus on the ones with higher demand, namely those living alone, older, male and poorly educated, so as to promote active aging. � 2022 Chinese Medical Journals Publishing House Co.Ltd.

The question therefore arises as to where this dietary protein required for meeting the protein demands of the rapidly aging global population should (or could) be obtained. Various non-animal-derived protein sources possess favorable sustainability credentials, though much less is known (compared with animal-derived proteins) about their ability to influence muscle anabolism. It is also likely that the anabolic potential of various alternative protein sources varies markedly, with the majority of options remaining to be investigated. The purpose of this review was to thoroughly assess the current evidence base for the utility of alternative protein sources (plants, fungi, insects, algae, and lab-grown ""meat"") to support muscle anabolism in (active) older adults. The solid existing data portfolio requires considerable expansion to encompass the strategic evaluation of the various types of dietary protein sources. Such data will ultimately be necessary to support desirable alterations and refinements in nutritional guidelines to support healthy and active aging, while concomitantly securing a sustainable food future. � The Author(s) 2022.

The measurements proposed are the Global Age Watch Index (GAI), the Active Aging Index (AAI), and the Aging Society Index (ASI). This document aims to present and discuss Mexico�s results on all three indexes and to contribute to the general discussion on the indexes� ability to design and implement public policies in specific contexts. Mexico got different results from each index, and the exercise helped identify some challenges of the indexes. The general balance between the referential framework and the methodology of the indexes is that they are a cross-sectional measurement of the situation of older adults. However, the actual posits leave aside a lifetime perspective and, for the GAI and ASI, a gender perspective. Moreover, they lack a solid theoretical discussion, and their methodologies fail to incorporate an adjustment for the demographical conditions of the countries, which can hardly yield comparable results. � 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",Garc�a-Pe�a C.; Sosa-Tinoco E.; Max-Monroy E.; M�ndez-Hern�ndez M.F.; J�come-Maldonado L.D.; Lozano-Ju�rez L.R.; Gonz�lez-Rivero C.B.; Guti�rrez-Robledo L.M.,"Garc�a-Pe�a, Carmen (23768203400); Sosa-Tinoco, Eduardo (36523865100); Max-Monroy, Emely (57862051400); M�ndez-Hern�ndez, Marcos Fernando (57861488000); J�come-Maldonado, Luis David (57219437448); Lozano-Ju�rez, Luis Raymundo (57224954474); Gonz�lez-Rivero, Cynthia Beatriz (57224955393); Guti�rrez-Robledo, Luis Miguel (56000834200)",23768203400; 36523865100; 57862051400; 57861488000; 57219437448; 57224954474; 57224955393; 56000834200,2022,Journal of Population Ageing,15,3,,843,862,19,0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136644988&doi=10.1007%2fs12062-022-09384-4&partnerID=40&md5=25a6926c67d6c55f1113acf5747d55f4,Mexico [North America]; adult; aging population; assessment method; policy implementation; social policy,Active aging; Composite indexes; Older adults; Population aging; Quality of life; Successful aging society,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85136644988,1,1,0,Mexico,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,NA,Healthy Aging,
36,10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2022.104388,Psychometric properties of measurement tools of active aging: A systematic review,"Background: Active aging has become a global goal under the current aging situation. Accurate and reproducible assessment tools are prerequisites to robust and reliable results for prevalence evaluation, associated factor exploration, and intervention effect assessment. However, there remains no systematic review to summarize all active aging assessment tools and report their psychometric properties. Objective: To identify and assess the psychometric properties of patient-reported outcome measures of active aging in older adults. Design: Systematic review of measurement properties using the Consensus-based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) methodology. Methods: Eight databases (PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, Cochrane library, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, CNKI, and Wanfang) were searched from January 2002 to February 2022. Studies that aim to validate patient-reported outcome measures of active aging in older adults aged 60 and over and report one or more psychometric properties were eligible for this systematic review. Methodological quality was assessed using the COSMIN Risk of Bias Checklist. We used the COSMIN criteria to summarize and rate the psychometric properties of each patient-reported outcome measure. A modified Grading, Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system was used to assess the certainty of evidence. Results: Twenty studies reported on the psychometric properties of 18 identified patient-reported outcome measures. Of the 20 included studies, seven explored more than five psychometric properties. Limited information was retrieved on cross-cultural validity/measurement invariance, reliability, criterion validity, hypothesis testing for construct validity, measurement error, and responsiveness. High-quality evidence on psychometric properties was provided for the Active Aging Scale and individual-level Active Aging Index. Conclusions: The findings from the included studies highlighted that the Active Aging Scale and individual-level Active Aging Index are strongly recommended to evaluate active aging in research and clinics based on the specific aims of assessment and the response burden for participants. Future studies should also develop or translate more active aging individual-level assessment tools and pay attention to the evaluation of psychometric properties.

Exercise can augment both factors independently; however, the influence of exercise on their interdependence is less clearly understood. Ultrasound speckle tracking is a sensitive novel measure of arterial aging but has not previously been used in middle-aged females. We aimed to elucidate the potential interactions between vascular and cognitive variables in active aging females. Methods: Twelve active (56 � 5�years; V ? O 2 peak: 34.5 � 6.1�ml.kg.min?1) and 13 inactive (57 � 4�years; 22.8 � 2.6�ml.kg.min?1) healthy middle-aged females were included. Ultrasound speckle tracking assessed short-axis common carotid artery (CCA) compliance via peak circumferential strain (PCS) and strain rate (PSR) at rest, during, and after 3-min isometric handgrip exercise. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery was assessed using ultrasound. Cognitive function was measured using Verbal Fluency, Trail Making, Stroop, and Digit Span tests. Results: PCS (P = 0.003) and PSR (P = 0.004), were higher in the active cohort. FMD was similar between groups (P > 0.05). Minimal differences in cognitive function existed between groups, although the inactive group performed better in one test of animal Verbal Fluency (P < 0.01). No associations were observed between PCS, PSR, or FMD with cognitive function (all P > 0.05). Conclusion: This is the first study to assess PCS and PSR in middle-aged females and demonstrates that active middle-aged females exhibit a superior carotid artery profile compared to their inactive counterparts. However, PCS and PSR of the carotid artery may not be linked with cognitive function in middle-aged females. � 2023, Crown.",Campbell A.K.; Beaumont A.J.; Hayes L.; Herbert P.; Gardner D.; Ritchie L.; Sculthorpe N.,"Campbell, Amy K.

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether walking difficulties predict changes in leading an active life during the COVID-19 social distancing recommendation compared to 2�years before, and whether self-rated resilience moderates this association among older people. Data were collected during social distancing recommendation in May and June 2020 and 2�years before (2017�18) among community-living AGNES study participants initially aged 75, 80, or 85�years (n = 809). Leading an active life was assessed with the University of Jyv�skyl� Active Aging Scale (UJACAS; total score range 0�272) and resilience with the 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (0�40). Self-reported walking difficulties over a 2�km distance were categorized into no difficulty, difficulty, and unable to walk. The total UJACAS score declined 24.9 points (SD 23.5) among those without walking difficulty, 27.0 (SD 25.0) among those reporting walking difficulty and 19.5 (SD 31.2) among those unable to walk 2�km. When adjusted for baseline UJACAS score, those unable to walk 2�km demonstrated the greatest decline. Baseline resilience moderated this association: Higher resilience was associated with less declines in UJACAS scores among persons with or without walking difficulty, and with more declines among persons unable to walk 2�km. When opportunities for leading an active life are compromised, those with less physical and psychological resources become particularly vulnerable to further declines in activity. � 2021, The Author(s).",Siltanen S.; Portegijs E.; Saajanaho M.; Pynn�nen K.; Kokko K.; Rantanen T.,"Siltanen, Sini (57201851205); Portegijs, Erja (24077018900); Saajanaho, Milla (55541789300); Pynn�nen, Katja (55427378700); Kokko, Katja (7003846844); Rantanen, Taina (7006330833)",57201851205; 24077018900; 55541789300; 55427378700; 7003846844; 7006330833,2022,European Journal of Ageing,19,3,,475,484,9,2,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85113799562&doi=10.1007%2fs10433-021-00634-6&partnerID=40&md5=248ec6d8ea3f468807a74c4848b1b88e,,Coping; Older people; Participation; Social distancing; Walking difficulty,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85113799562,1,0,0,Finland,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,809,0,0,0,0,75+,Active Aging,

By emphasizing the concept of active aging, determining the status of the elderly like their ability to continue work over time, to attain income and to participate in social and political life is significant. Active aging uses the indicators measuring the non-used potential of the elderly for having an active and healthy aging. This study aimed to determine the level of active aging among the provinces of Iran in 2018 by considering 11 indicators related to elderly�s health, well-being and socioeconomic participation. Methods: The raw data were obtained from�Statistical Center of Iran. After establishing the indicators based on the Global Age Watch approach, the provinces were ranked by the TOPSIS method in terms of aging status. Results: The results indicated that only Tehran and Alborz had the highest development level of active aging while 16% of the provinces had a semi-developed status and 77% failed at experiencing a satisfactory welfare, economic and social status. Conclusions: Four indicators had the highest importance included the percentage of the elderly with a diploma and academic degree, the percentage of the elderly with lower incomes than the median income, the median income of the elderly to the median income of the other people in society, and life expectancy among the 65-year old men. Studying the indicators deeply can result in the appropriate planning for each area in line with the improvement of the elderly status. � 2022, The Author(s).",Saberzadeh V.; Emamgholipour Sefiddashti S.; Safaei Lari M.,"Saberzadeh, Vahid (57577231100); Emamgholipour Sefiddashti, Sara (57201880284); Safaei Lari, Majid (57221534597)",57577231100; 57201880284; 57221534597,2022,BMC Public Health,22,1,764,,,,1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128314772&doi=10.1186%2fs12889-022-13040-z&partnerID=40&md5=daaa2ecd3889cfc319621c909a46041c,Aged; Aging; Humans; Income; Iran; Life Expectancy; Male; Social Welfare; Socioeconomic Factors; aged; aging; article; clinical article; controlled study; healthy aging; human; human experiment; Iran; life expectancy; male; poverty; social status; technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution; welfare; wellbeing; aging; epidemiology; income; social welfare; socioeconomics,Active aging; Economic participation rate; Life expectancy; Poverty rate; Provincial planning; Relative welfare,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85128314772,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,"Active Aging, Healthy Aging",
40,10.1111/josi.12540,Eradicating ageism through social campaigns: An Israeli case study in the shadows of the COVID-19 pandemic,"This study examined three social campaigns for the eradication of ageism that were undertaken in Israel during the COVID-19 pandemic (April, 2020�May, 2021). The documentation and analysis of the campaigns were undertaken via the lens of the Theory of Change and Five Key Principles for social campaigns: planning strategically, communicating effectively, fostering community engagement, implementing key activities, and using research. We conducted desk reviews and qualitative interviews with the campaigns� organizers. The Theory of Change implemented by the campaigns targeted self-ageism among independent older people and/or employers of older adults. All campaigns emphasized �active aging� and �successful aging,� to decrease (self)-ageism. The focus on one dimension of active and positive aging may result in ageism and exclusion of older people who do not fit into the category of independent and active people. The complex timing of the campaigns had influenced the degree of implementation of the five key principles. The joining of forces of different organizations and the employment of more diverse representations of old age, may facilitate the achievement of campaign goals. Finally, an empirical evaluation of social campaigns� efforts is still necessary to gather evidence about the effectiveness of social campaigns. � 2022 The Authors.

41,10.1016/j.jaging.2021.100937,�Carving a future out of the past and the present�: Rethinking aging futures,"This article emerged out of arts-based research carried out in Nogojiwanong (Peterborough, Canada) in 2019, which explored community members' perspectives on aging futures within their shared place. Over the course of 2 days, a diverse intergenerational group came together to imagine positive aging futures, recording a series of group discussions and co-creating art through this process. Analyzed against efforts to expand dominant �successful aging� discourses, this research revealed three key themes. First, in contrast to unrooted and individualistic assumptions embedded within successful aging, participants identified attentiveness to place and community, and in particular relationships with Michi Saagiig Nishnaabeg land, territory, and nation, as key to their visions for successful aging futures. Second, challenging assumptions about hetero-reproductive generativity as necessary for aging well, participants described their commitments to intergenerational relationships that are expansive, beyond biological ties, and existing within interspecies networks of relationships. Finally, contesting underpinning notions of aging as part of a linear process ending in death � and successful aging as inherently a struggle against this process � participants explored aging futures as part of a spiral temporality involving regeneration, identifying relationships with people and place that extend beyond the linear timeframe of singular lives, connected forward into a more distant future and backward into a longer past. We draw forth these themes in the interest of queering and decolonizing ongoing conversations surrounding successful aging and generativity within the field of aging studies. � 2021 Elsevier Inc.",Chazan M.; Whetung M.,"Chazan, May (21933432500); Whetung, Madeline (57203648360)",21933432500; 57203648360,2022,Journal of Aging Studies,63,,100937,,,,2,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85105321113&doi=10.1016%2fj.jaging.2021.100937&partnerID=40&md5=0c64dc6531a00ac6e1905ad0ccf280c1,Aging; Canada; Communication; Humans; adult; article; attention; conversation; healthy aging; human; regeneration; vision; aging; Canada; interpersonal communication,Decolonizing aging; Futures; Futurisms; Intergenerationality; Queering generativity; Spiral time; Successful aging,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85105321113,1,0,0,Canada,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,NA,0,0,1,1,NA,Successful Aging ,

Gerontologists have criticized the age-based definition of risk groups for their underlying agism. Objective: From a practice-theoretical perspective the article asks through which social practices a vulnerable age is realized during the COVID-19 pandemic. Material and methods: The article refers to data from six qualitative interviews with people aged 65 and older. The data was analyzed using fine structure analysis followed by a topic analysis. Results: The results show that during the COVID-19 pandemic doing age was characterized by a not doing or the disappearance of routinized everyday practices. For the respondents this not doing age was connected to experiencing vulnerable ageing, in which they felt physically and temporally vulnerable. Discussion: Practices of aging during the COVID-19 pandemic have developed against the backdrop of a societal discourse that has positioned activity as an indicator of good and positive aging. At the same time few opportunities have been created to maintain activity under the conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic. � 2022, The Author(s).",Gallistl V.; Bohrn K.; Rohner R.; Kolland F.,"Gallistl, Vera (57203169419); Bohrn, Karoline (58024150800); Rohner, Rebekka (57218895421); Kolland, Franz (23093973000)",57203169419; 58024150800; 57218895421; 23093973000,2023,Zeitschrift fur Gerontologie und Geriatrie,56,1,,18,22,4,0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85144345623&doi=10.1007%2fs00391-022-02143-2&partnerID=40&md5=7523d8361a94f47161b8ff941d291ba8,Ageism; Aging; COVID-19; Geriatricians; Humans; Pandemics; ageism; aging; epidemiology; geriatrician; human; pandemic,Ageism; Critical gerontology; Doing age; Qualitative research; Risk group,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85144345623,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,65+,"Vulnerable Aging, Good and Positive Aging",
43,10.3389/fpubh.2022.942311,The mediation and interaction of depressive symptoms in activities of daily living and active aging in rural elderly: A cross-sectional survey,"Background: Compared with urban areas, old adults in rural areas have limited access to medical and health resources in China. Active of daily living ability (ADL) decline and depressive symptoms are common in rural older adults. In particular, the depressive symptoms of the elderly in rural areas are often ignored. Thus, it is difficult to realize high-level active aging at the individual level. In order to explore the effects of ADL and depressive symptoms on the active aging of rural elderly, we conducted a survey and analyzed the mediation and interaction effects of depressive symptoms of ADL on active aging. Methods: From July to November 2019, a cross-sectional study of 945 elderly rural individuals was conducted in three townships in Xiangtan County, China. Active aging, ADL, and depressive symptoms were assessed using the positive aging questionnaire (PAEQ), ADL scale, and depression in old age scale (DIA-S), respectively. PROCESS macro program model 4 and logistic regression were used to explore the mediation and interaction between ADL and depressive symptoms on active aging. Results: The proportions of rural elderly with an active aging level were 23.5% (well above average), 50.9% (above average), 24.1% (below average), 1.5% (well below average), respectively. The rates of ADL decline and depressive symptoms were 44.7 and 19.7%, respectively. Mediated effect analysis showed that the relationship between ADL and active aging could be partly mediated by depressive symptoms (ab = ?0.2382, boot SE = 0.0437), and the 95% confidence interval was [?0.3311, ?0.1584]. The mediating effect proportion of the total effect was 30.7%. Logistic regression showed that ADL and depressive symptoms have an interactive additive effect on active aging. The relative excess risk of interaction (RERI), the attributable proportion due to interaction (API), and the synergy index (SI) scores were 13.109, 0.621, and 2.871, respectively. Older adults with ADL decline and depressive symptoms had higher (OR = 21.115) odds of well-below-average active aging compared with older adults with ADL decline (OR = 3.258) or only depressive symptoms (OR = 5.749). Conclusion: The findings suggest that the association between ADL and active aging is persistent and partly mediated by depressive symptoms, and comorbid depressive symptoms and ADL decline have an additive effect on active aging. Maintaining independence is an important factor for realizing active aging. However, for the rural elderly with ADL decline and low-level active aging, we can promote the realization of high-level active aging at the individual level through the prevention and treatment of depressive symptoms based on multidisciplinary care.

44,10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1043921,Social isolation and loneliness among Chinese older adults: Examining aging attitudes as mediators and moderators,"Due to labor migration and social changes, the Chinese elderly are facing significant social isolation, along with changes in aging attitudes. However, whether social isolation affects loneliness among the Chinese elderly and whether this relationship is moderated and mediated by aging attitudes is unclear. This empirical study aimed to respond to the above questions in the Chinese context, Based on the data from the 2014 China Longitudinal Aging Social Survey (N = 6,645), the results showed that social isolation is a positive predictor of loneliness; aging attitudes mediate the relationship between social isolation and loneliness. Social isolation affects the loneliness of the elderly partially by weakening positive aging attitudes and strengthening negative aging attitudes; aging attitudes moderate the effect of social isolation on loneliness. For those older adults with higher positive aging attitudes, social isolation has a much smaller effect on loneliness. While for those older adults with higher negative aging attitudes, social isolation has a more substantial effect on their feelings of loneliness. Our results indicate that less social isolation is an effective way to relieve loneliness, and maintaining higher positive aging attitudes and lower negative aging attitudes, is important for the Chinese elderly to prevent loneliness when facing social isolation.

Currently, none of the proposed solutions can simultaneously inhibit exciton quenching caused by the ZnO-based electron-transporting layer (ETL) and retain other advantages of ZnO. Here in this work, we propose a bilayer design of ETL in which a buffer layer assembled of SnO2 nanoparticles (NPs) suppresses the QD-ETL exciton quenching and tunes charge balance while ZnO NPs provide high electron conductivity. As a result, the bottom-emitting QLED combining capped ZnO and SnO2 buffer exhibit a maximum luminance over 100,000 cd m?2 and a T95 operational lifetime averaging 6200 h at 1000 cd m?2 on the premise of entirely inhibiting positive aging. � 2022, The Author(s).",Ye Z.; Chen M.; Chen X.; Ma W.; Sun X.; Wu L.; Lin X.; Chen Y.; Chen S.,"Ye, Zi (57278683900); Chen, Mengyu (55765609300); Chen, Xingtong (57218576514); Ma, Wenchen (57465421800); Sun, Xiaojuan (57223390016); Wu, Longjia (57211896485); Lin, Xiongfeng (57780048600); Chen, Yu (57225200456); Chen, Song (57192605356)",57278683900; 55765609300; 57218576514; 57465421800; 57223390016; 57211896485; 57780048600; 57225200456; 57192605356,2022,npj Flexible Electronics,6,1,96,,,,0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85143156934&doi=10.1038%2fs41528-022-00231-2&partnerID=40&md5=f0782596446f98b4f33e57a82496a727,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85143156934,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
46,10.1080/03601277.2022.2160571,Positive aging: feasibility and acceptability of an eHealth ACT module for middle-aged and older adults,"Previous research emphasizes the importance of well-being in old age and its association with positive mental and physical health at earlier stages of aging during midlife. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy has the potential to support positive aging processes. This study examines the feasibility and acceptability of a new unguided eHealth ACT module in a population from 40 years onwards. Data were collected at two measurement points in time (before and after completion of the ACT module). In total, 313 participants (range = 40�75 years; mean(SD) = 54 years (8.3); 76% female) had 8 weeks access to the ACT module and responded to the feasibility questionnaire, upon completion of the module. Logged data (time spent online per session and in total, number of attended sessions) was also analyzed. Of the respondents, 76% reported a completion rate of 75%�100%. On average, 3.5 h (SD = 6.4) per week were spent on the module and practicing the ACT skills. The mean evaluation of the module was 7.4 (SD = 1.2, range = 1�10). Approximately 80% of the participants rated each session as (very) good. Absence of guidance was marked as a limitation. The results indicate good feasibility and acceptance of this unguided eHealth module. This is a promising result as this is, to our knowledge, the first study applying an eHealth ACT module to the general population in the context of positive aging. The effectiveness results will be addressed in a future paper. � 2023 The Author(s).

47,10.1093/geront/gnac074,Do Latino Older Adults and Service Providers Agree on Positive Aging? Using Concept Mapping to Compare Perspectives,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In the United States, Latino adults are a growing segment of the aging population who will need research-informed interventions to help them age successfully. Arguably, how Latino older adults and service providers understand ""positive aging"" serves as an important precursor for the cultivation of such interventions. This investigation explored whether Latino older adults' conceptualizations of positive aging aligned with those of service providers. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We compared how Latino older adults (n = 93) and service providers (n = 45) rated 85 positive aging statements produced by Latino older adults. These 85 items were used to generate a concept map, which displays those items thematically by clusters and overarching regions of meaning. RESULTS: We found divergences at each level of the map-statements, clusters, and regions-which illuminate differences between how service providers and Latino older adults think about Latino positive aging. For example, whereas Latino older adults prioritized the cluster containing items related to internal well-being, service providers rated it seventh of 11 clusters. The region comprising clusters related to relationships garnered the highest agreement between groups, but also a notable departure; compared to Latino older adults, service providers rated community and social involvement as less important. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Understanding such differences can help providers tailor services consistent with the interests of Latino older adults. Future studies should examine the extent to which stakeholders believe various aspects of positive aging are modifiable. � The Author(s) 2022.

48,10.6209/JORIES.202209_67(3).0006,Older Adults� Motivation for Social Contact of Learning and Active Aging: The Mediating Effect of Attitudes Toward Aging,"1. Introduction In our aging society, older adult learning is increasingly valued. Learning allows older adults to adapt to changes brought about by aging, to enhance self-confidence, and to face new challenges. Research has shown that social contact motivation in learning is associated with active aging and improved health and security. However, the mechanism through which the social contact motivation of older adults influences active aging requires further research. Past studies stress the importance of older adults understanding their attitudes toward the aging process. Older adults who report a more positive attitude toward aging exhibit increased participation in health promotion behaviors, which in turn allows older adults to truly practice the concept of active aging. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the mediating effect of attitude toward aging among older adults on social contact motivation in learning and on active aging. 2. Methods Older adults (older than 55 years) in northern Taiwan were recruited. A total of 101 valid questionnaires were collected from the pretest. The age of the respondents ranged from 55 to 81 years; the mean age was 61.58 years. Furthermore, 17 respondents were male (16.8%) and 84 respondents were female (83.2%). In the study proper, a total of 231 valid questionnaires were collected. The age ranged from 55-83 years; the mean age was 62.87 years. In addition, 63respondents were male (27.3%) and 168 respondents were female (72.7%). Three scales were used: The first measured social contact motivation, which was adapted from the adult learning motivation scale (Kim & Merriam, 2004); the second measured attitude toward aging (Shenkin et al., 2014); and the third measured active aging (Lin, 2012). Social contact motivation refers to contact with friends and making new friends as motivation for learning. The aging attitude scale was developed by Shenkin et al. (2014) in cooperation with the World Health Organization; it measures both positive and negative attitudes toward aging. The active aging scale was developed by Lin (2012). The scale has three dimensions: Health, participation, and security. In the pretest, exploratory factor analysis and internal consistency analysis were conducted, and items in the pretest questionnaire were deleted and revised to develop a formal questionnaire. All scales were demonstrated to be valid in a factor analysis, and an overall Cronbach�s alpha of 0.74-0.86 indicated reliability. Structural equation modeling (SEM) with bootstrapping was used for the analysis. 3. Results Correlation analysis indicated that scores for social contact motivation, active aging, and attitudes toward aging were all significantly correlated. Mediating effects were then investigated through SEM. The model had good fit (?2 ?df = 3.16, p = 0.00, goodness of fit index = 0.89, adjusted goodness of fit index = 0.86, and root mean square error of approximation = 0.07). Therefore, the model was credible and stable. This study calculated the 95% confidence interval and used 2000 repeated samples. The model had �physiological change attitude� and �positive aging attitude� as variables mediating the relationship between social contact motivation and active aging. The SEM results are displayed as follows: 3.1 Direct Effects and Mediating Effects Social contact motivation had a direct relationship with all three dimensions of active aging: Health (r = 0.69, p <.05), participation (r = 0.79, p <.05), and security (r = 0.73, p <.05). Potential mediating effects were then examined. Physiological change attitude fully mediated the relationships of social contact motivation with two of the three dimensions of active aging, specifically health (r = 0.17, p <.05) and participation (r = 0.18, p <.05). Physiological change attitude partially mediated the relationship between social contact motivation and the security dimension of active aging (r = 0.15, p <.05). Positive aging attitude fully mediated the relationship between social contact motivation and the health dimension of active aging (r = 0.18, p <.01) and partially mediated the relationship between social contact motivation and the security dimension of active aging (r = 0.20, p <.01). 4. Conclusions This study examined the effects of social contact motivation and attitudes toward aging on active aging. The results demonstrated that improved social contact motivation and attitudes toward aging enhances active aging in older adults. Specifically, the results of this study suggest that (1) attitude toward physiological changes mediates the relationship between social contact motivation and the health, participation, and security dimensions of active aging and (2) positive aging attitude mediates the relationship between social contact motivation and the health and security dimensions of active aging. Therefore, older adults� social contact motivation for learning influences their attitudes toward aging, including their attitudes toward physiological change; this in turn, enhances the health, participation, and security dimensions of active aging. 5. Limitations and Recommendations for Future Studies This research has several limitations. This study only recruited older adults in Taipei City. Future studies should recruit individual from different regions and age groups and explore a wider set of other variables, such as personality traits and barriers to participation in learning. They may also adopt a control group in their analyses to enable causal inference. � 2022, National Taiwan Normal University.

As in theory digital media can support both preservation of and access to someone�s social capital, we also explored associations between the use of WhatsApp, social network sites (SNS) and Internet applications and respectively BSC and loneliness. Method: In this cross-sectional study a sample of 349 older adults (range = 70y�93y; Mean(SD)=74.8y(4.9y); 59.6% male) filled out a questionnaire including the bonding social capital subscale of the personal social capital scale for elderly (PSCSE), validated scales measuring social, emotional, and psychological well-being and loneliness, the SNS intensity scale and items measuring frequencies of Whatsapp use and use of various Internet functions. Also relevant demographic and other covariates were included. Results: Regression analyses including relevant covariates confirmed our hypotheses, finding negative associations between BSC and both age and loneliness, and positive associations between BSC and psychological, social and emotional well-being. WhatsApp and Internet use were both found positively associated with BSC, whilst a negative association between WhatsApp use and loneliness was found. SNS use was not associated with BSC nor with loneliness. Conclusion: Our findings indicate BSC as an important factor in positive aging and illustrate a widening gap between the need for socio-emotional resources versus their availability. With regard to digital media, we conclude that its value in old age should be sought in providing access to one�s bonding social capital rather than adding to it by expanding the number of social relations. � 2022 The Author(s).

50,10.1038/s41598-022-09807-4,Age-related changes to vestibular heave and pitch perception and associations with postural control,"Falls are a common cause of injury in older adults (OAs), and age-related declines across the sensory systems are associated with increased falls risk. The vestibular system is particularly important for maintaining balance and supporting safe mobility, and aging has been associated with declines in vestibular end-organ functioning. However, few studies have examined potential age-related differences in vestibular perceptual sensitivities or their association with postural stability. Here we used an adaptive-staircase procedure to measure detection and discrimination thresholds in 19 healthy OAs and 18 healthy younger adults (YAs), by presenting participants with passive heave (linear up-and-down translations) and pitch (forward�backward tilt rotations) movements on a motion-platform in the dark. We also examined participants� postural stability under various standing-balance conditions. Associations among these postural measures and vestibular perceptual thresholds were further examined. Ultimately, OAs showed larger heave and pitch detection thresholds compared to YAs, and larger perceptual thresholds were associated with greater postural sway, but only in OAs. Overall, these results suggest that vestibular perceptual sensitivity declines with older age and that such declines are associated with poorer postural stability. Future studies could consider the potential applicability of these results in the development of screening tools for falls prevention in OAs. � 2022, The Author(s).",Gabriel G.A.; Harris L.R.; Gnanasegaram J.J.; Cushing S.L.; Gordon K.A.; Haycock B.C.; Campos J.L.,"Gabriel, Grace A.

51,10.1016/j.bbi.2022.12.013,Intermittent systemic exposure to lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation disrupts hippocampal long-term potentiation and impairs cognition in aging male mice,"Age-related cognitive decline, a common component of the brain aging process, is associated with significant impairment in daily functioning and quality of life among geriatric adults. While the complexity of mechanisms underlying cognitive aging are still being elucidated, microbial exposure and the multifactorial inflammatory cascades associated with systemic infections are emerging as potential drivers of neurological senescence. The negative cognitive and neurobiological consequences of a single pathogen-associated inflammatory experience, such as that modeled through treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), are well documented. Yet, the brain aging impacts of repeated, intermittent inflammatory challenges are less well studied. To extend the emerging literature assessing the impact of infection burden on cognitive function among normally aging mice, here, we repeatedly exposed adult mice to intermittent LPS challenges during the aging period. Male 10-month-old C57BL6 mice were systemically administered escalating doses of LPS once every two weeks for 2.5 months. We evaluated cognitive consequences using the non-spatial step-through inhibitory avoidance task, and both spatial working and reference memory versions of the Morris water maze. We also probed several potential mechanisms, including cortical and hippocampal cytokine/chemokine gene expression, as well as hippocampal neuronal function via extracellular field potential recordings. Though there was limited evidence for an ongoing inflammatory state in cortex and hippocampus, we observed impaired learning and memory and a disruption of hippocampal long-term potentiation. These data suggest that a history of intermittent exposure to LPS-induced inflammation is associated with subtle but significantly impaired cognition among normally aging mice.

52,10.1016/j.erss.2022.102852,"Opportunity, ideal or distraction? Exploring stakeholder perceptions of tackling energy poverty and vulnerability among older Australians","Energy vulnerability intersects with housing, social and health issues, yet current siloed approaches and piece-meal energy assistance initiatives are often leaving �hard to reach� older householders behind. Cross-disciplinary strategies promise better identification of vulnerable people, sustained relief and scalable solutions, yet such innovative approaches are still rare. Using the Australian in-home aged care services as a case study, this research explored how stakeholders perceived the idea of integrating energy assistance with health services for people aged 65 and over. Understanding the views of potential advocates and adopters may guide the development, design and implementation of such an innovation. This study engaged front-line workers, executives and policy makers across organisations aiming at carbon emission reduction, equity and health. Climate action stakeholders and in-home aged care services staff recognised synergies across their programmes and welcomed the idea as an opportunity to address hidden energy poverty. Equity stakeholders perceived it as an ideal and doubted that its aspirations were likely to be fully realised given the priorities of vulnerable, older people. An aged care services industry representative, however, saw this proposition as a distraction from dealing with the broader challenges of an ageing population. These insights highlight the need to co-design such an initiative. The engagement of health policy makers is critical but challenging. Further research is needed to align energy assistance with the needs and circumstances of in-home aged care services clients and to develop solutions for older renters. � 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Willand N.,"Willand, Nicola (55906606200)",55907000000,2022,Energy Research and Social Science,94,,102852,,,,0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85141433389&doi=10.1016%2fj.erss.2022.102852&partnerID=40&md5=eb28a82e7913ccf0c055209d53c171ed,,Elderly; Energy poverty; Hard to reach; Health; In-home aged care services,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85141433389,1,0,0,Australia,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,NA,0,0,0,0,65+,NA,
53,10.1016/j.mad.2022.111761,The role of cytokines/chemokines in an aging skin immune microenvironment,"Reversing or slowing down the skin aging process is one of the most intriguing areas of focus across the social and scientific communities around the world. While aging is considered a universal and inevitable natural process of physiological decline, the aging of the skin is the most apparent visual representation of an individual's health. Aging skin may be objectively defined by epidermal thinning; increased transepidermal water loss; decreased cutaneous barrier function; loss of elasticity, laxity, and textured appearance; and gradual deterioration of the epidermal immune environment. As the largest structure of the immune system and of the body as a whole, the skin is the most vulnerable barrier of defense against the environment. The skin reflects an individual's exposures, lifestyle habits, and overall health. From an immunological perspective, cytokines and chemokines act as a central character in the communicating of the immunity in skin aging. These cell signaling proteins serve as the intercellular communication link. This review aims to elucidate how cell-cell crosstalk through cytokines and chemokines, and the interplay between host cells, infiltrating immune cells, and exogenous factors contribute to the overall aging skin. � 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Lin Z.-C.; Hsu C.-Y.; Hwang E.; Wang P.-W.; Fang J.-Y.,"Lin, Zih-Chan (56269916700); Hsu, Ching-Yun (7404945778); Hwang, Erica (58003618600); Wang, Pei-Wen (57992613000); Fang, Jia-You (7402966200)",56269916700; 7404945778; 58003618600; 57992613000; 7402966200,2023,Mechanisms of Ageing and Development,210,,111761,,,,0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85143892269&doi=10.1016%2fj.mad.2022.111761&partnerID=40&md5=7671b28e233e7117695622b0d198449f,Chemokines; Cytokines; Skin; Skin Aging; chemokine; cytokine; chemokine; cytokine; adipocyte; aging; Article; cell communication; cell infiltration; cutaneous parameters; epidermis cell; extrinsic aging; fibroblast; host cell; human; immune system; immunocompetent cell; inflammaging; intrinsic aging; keratinocyte; melanocyte; microenvironment; molecular mechanics; protein function; receptor cross-talk; skin structure; metabolism; skin,Aging; Chemokine; Cytokine; Immune cell; Inflammaging; Skin,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85143892269,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,

The aim of the present study is to provide an overview of the current evidence regarding the effect of apigenin on different dermatological complications. Electronic databases including PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched to retrieve all papers assessing the dermatological effects of apigenin. Preclinical studies support beneficial effects of apigenin on UV-induced skin damage, vitiligo, dermatitis, wounds, skin aging, and some types of skin cancer. The compound mostly acts via inhibition of inflammation through suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and intracellular inflammatory mediators, as well as antioxidant properties such as improvement of endogenous antioxidant defense mechanisms. There are also some studies for the design and development of novel drug delivery systems for apigenin to improve its oral and topical bioavailability. Nevertheless, no clinical study has evaluated apigenin as a natural supplement for skin conditions. Considering the benefits of apigenin in preclinical models of dermatological disorders, as well as the acceptable safety of this compound, apigenin may be a future candidate to be used in dermatological disorders. Future clinical studies are needed to further confirm the safety and efficacy of apigenin in skin care products. � 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Majma Sanaye P.; Mojaveri M.R.; Ahmadian R.; Sabet Jahromi M.; Bahramsoltani R.,"Majma Sanaye, Pantea (57858063000); Mojaveri, Mohammad Reza (57858063100); Ahmadian, Roohollah (57211456383); Sabet Jahromi, Mehdi (57858063200); Bahramsoltani, Roodabeh (56190467300)",57858063000; 57858063100; 57211456383; 57858063200; 56190467300,2022,Phytochemistry,203,,113390,,,,1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136577846&doi=10.1016%2fj.phytochem.2022.113390&partnerID=40&md5=6e0245df339ba7a0e57644786d692a14,Antioxidants; Apigenin; Cytokines; Flavonoids; Humans; Inflammation Mediators; antioxidant; apigenin; autacoid; cytokine; flavonoid; human,Antioxidant; Apigenin; Cancer; Flavonoid; Inflammation; Skin,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85136577846,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
55,10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1015313,"�I'm too old for this!�: A prospective, multilevel study of job characteristics, age, and turnover intention","Introduction: Deciding to leave a job is often foreshadowed by burgeoning job dissatisfaction, which is in turn often attributed to characteristics of the job and work environment. However, while we know that job characteristics influence job satisfaction, health, and motivation, their associations with turnover intention is less clear. Moreover, despite aging workforces, an understanding of how working conditions influence workers across the lifespan is lacking. Therefore, drawing on job design theories and bridging turnover- and aging research, we studied 15 specific job characteristics to determine whether they predicted turnover intentions, and whether the predictive value was modified by age. Methods: Data were collected from various public and private enterprises in Norway. Moderated multilevel regressions were conducted cross-sectionally (N = 12,485) and prospectively over 2 years (N = 5,504). Results: Most work factors were associated with turnover intention at both the individual and work unit levels. A social climate of support, trust, and encouragement was most strongly inversely associated with turnover intentions, while role conflict was most strongly positively associated with turnover intentions. Organizational climate, leadership styles, and job control were more important with age while job demands, predictability and role stressors were more important to younger workers. Ten individual level- and four work-unit level factors predicted turnover intentions prospectively, suggesting turnover intentions due to poor working conditions persisted in employees that did not quit. Discussion: Our results highlight several specific, modifiable job characteristics that are likely to affect turnover intentions, and the impact of certain factors specifically for older workers.

56,10.1038/s41598-022-08130-2,Kinetic interplay between droplet maturation and coalescence modulates shape of aged protein condensates,"Biomolecular condensates formed by the process of liquid�liquid phase separation (LLPS) play diverse roles inside cells, from spatiotemporal compartmentalisation to speeding up chemical reactions. Upon maturation, the liquid-like properties of condensates, which underpin their functions, are gradually lost, eventually giving rise to solid-like states with potential pathological implications. Enhancement of inter-protein interactions is one of the main mechanisms suggested to trigger the formation of solid-like condensates. To gain a molecular-level understanding of how the accumulation of stronger interactions among proteins inside condensates affect the kinetic and thermodynamic properties of biomolecular condensates, and their shapes over time, we develop a tailored coarse-grained model of proteins that transition from establishing weak to stronger inter-protein interactions inside condensates. Our simulations reveal that the fast accumulation of strongly binding proteins during the nucleation and growth stages of condensate formation results in aspherical solid-like condensates. In contrast, when strong inter-protein interactions appear only after the equilibrium condensate has been formed, or when they accumulate slowly over time with respect to the time needed for droplets to fuse and grow, spherical solid-like droplets emerge. By conducting atomistic potential-of-mean-force simulations of NUP-98 peptides�prone to forming inter-protein ?-sheets�we observe that formation of inter-peptide ?-sheets increases the strength of the interactions consistently with the loss of liquid-like condensate properties we observe at the coarse-grained level. Overall, our work aids in elucidating fundamental molecular, kinetic, and thermodynamic mechanisms linking the rate of change in protein interaction strength to condensate shape and maturation during ageing. � 2022, The Author(s).",Garaizar A.; Espinosa J.R.; Joseph J.A.; Collepardo-Guevara R.,"Garaizar, Adiran (57209311970); Espinosa, Jorge R.

The results showed that the overall mechanical properties were optimal when the dosage of GO was 0.05%. Meanwhile, the UV aging resistance, anticorrosion and impermeability of the coating were also enhanced by the incorporation of GO. In addition, MIP, SEM, and FTIR test were used to investigate its mechanism.

58,10.1109/TDMR.2022.3175914,Reliable Circuit Design Using a Fast Incremental-Based Gate Sizing Under Process Variation,"As CMOS devices become smaller, aging-induced and process variations become major issues for circuit reliability. In this paper, a statistical gate sizing method is proposed to improve the lifetime reliability of manufactured chips in the presence of process variations and aging effects. To this end, we propose a canonical first order delay model to estimate the delay degradation of a gate under negative bias temperature instability and process variations considering spatial correlations. Using the proposed gate delay model, a statistical static timing analysis method is introduced to compute the circuit delay considering the joint effect of process variation and negative bias temperature instability. To guarantee that the circuit meets the required timing constraints, we propose an incremental gate sizing technique. This technique first computes the criticality of each gate defined as the probability that a gate lies on the critical path due to negative bias temperature instability and process variations. Then, a group of gates with the highest ranking according to criticality is chosen for a gate sizing-based timing optimization. It is worth nothing that, by using the proposed statistical gate delay model, we can compute the criticality of each gate incrementally. Experimental results based on ISCAS'85 benchmark circuits show that the proposed method can improve the lifetime reliability defined as 1.1(mu + 3sigma) of the initial delay distribution of the circuit at the expense of 8.64% area overhead. In comparison with the path-based method, the proposed approach is much faster, especially for larger circuits, which makes it a viable solution to optimize the lifetime reliability of very large-scale circuits used in industry. � 2001-2011 IEEE.",Ghavami B.; Raji M.; Ibrami M.; Shannon L.,"Ghavami, Behnam (23008458900); Raji, Mohsen (26666252800); Ibrami, Milad (57701225800); Shannon, Lesley (57703082800)",23008458900; 26666252800; 57701225800; 57703082800,2022,IEEE Transactions on Device and Materials Reliability,22,3,,371,380,9,0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130456048&doi=10.1109%2fTDMR.2022.3175914&partnerID=40&md5=dc9a85f1da9ef7173a105da5d457e228,Criticality (nuclear fission); Delay circuits; Gates (transistor); Integrated circuit manufacture; Logic gates; Negative temperature coefficient; Thermodynamic stability; Timing circuits; Circuit reliability; Delay; Gate sizing; Gate sizing.; Incremental analysis; Integrated circuit modeling; Integrated circuit reliability; Lifetime reliability; Optimisations; Process Variation; Negative bias temperature instability,aging; Circuit reliability; gate sizing; incremental analysis; NBTI; process variations,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85130456048,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
59,10.1134/S1027451022060544,Study of the Composite Piezoelectric Coatings Used in Sensing Elements,"Abstract: The design of the measuring circuit of a system of structural health monitoring of objects based on a piezosensitive matrix is presented. It is shown that a promising trend in the design of matrices of bulk piezosensitive materials and piezocoatings is the possibility of using phosphate binders. The proposed structure of a piezocoating based on a phosphate binder consists of five alternately formed layers. The piezoelectric layer is formed at a temperature from 10 to 30?C with subsequent polarization for 3 h at an electrical voltage of no more than 300 V and a temperature of no more than 120?C. The dielectric and piezoelectric characteristics of the piezocomposite samples formed from a piezoelectric material similar to PZT-19 and a phosphate binder in the mass ratio of 10 : 1 are presented. Polarized samples are subjected to artificial aging by exposure at a temperature of 80?C for 10 days, after which piezosensitivities d33 and d31 and relative dielectric permittivity (Formula presented.) are measured. In addition, a technique is developed to estimate the critical number of cycles of switching the polarity of the electric field applied to a thin-film sample made of a ceramic dielectric. The technique is based on approximation of the dependence of the residual polarization on the number of cycles of switching the polarity of the electric field applied to the sample. This makes it possible to predict the deviation of the dielectric properties of the sample material from the required values. The results of the full-scale experiment confirmed the possibility of creating a piezoelectric material based on a phosphate binder for the fabrication of sensitive elements of the structural health monitoring systems. � 2022, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",Tsypin B.V.; Pecherskaya E.A.; Kikot V.V.; Koshkin G.A.; Fimin A.V.,"Tsypin, B.V.

60,10.1007/s12126-023-09524-x,Selective Attention and Inhibitory Processing in Older Adults: The Impact of Dietary Creatine,"Aims: The purpose was to examine the relationship between dietary creatine intake obtained in food and selective attention and inhibitory control processes in older adults. Methods: Forty-five (n = 11 males; n = 34 females) participants over 60 years of age volunteered. Participants completed a 5-day dietary recall survey to estimate creatine intake and a cognitive assessment which included an adaptation of the Eriksen flanker task and a mini-mental state examination (MMSE). Cohorts for two groups were derived based on higher (HCr) versus lower (LCr) median creatine intake. To compare the groups, an unpaired Mann-Whitney U test was performed. In addition, Spearman�s correlation analysis was used to test a potential association between the daily amount of creatine with selective attention and inhibitory processing task results. Results: There were significant differences between the groups in the flanker task. In the incongruent condition, HCr responded on average about 646 ms faster than LCr (p =.005). HCr also responded about 25% more accurately than LCr in the incongruent condition (p <.001). Response time to incongruent stimuli (Spearman�s -0.424) and per cent correct (Spearman�s rho 0.565) showed moderate correlations with daily creatine intake. Conclusions: Creatine intake from food is positively associated with selective attention and inhibitory processing in older adults. � 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Machado M.; Oliveira E.F.; Neumann E.,"Machado, Marco (56799832900); Oliveira, Edimar F (57814722100); Neumann, Ewald (7202005820)",56799832900; 57814722100; 7202005820,2023,Ageing International,,,,,,,0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85147769571&doi=10.1007%2fs12126-023-09524-x&partnerID=40&md5=7d57f9ff9d80a1ec2ef1d03fc293563b,,Ageing; Creatine; Flanker task; Inhibitory control; Nutrition; Selective attention,Article,Article in press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85147769571,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,45,0,1,0,0,60+,NA,
61,10.1152/ajplung.00023.2022,Pim-1 kinase is a positive feedback regulator of the senescent lung fibroblast inflammatory secretome,"Cellular senescence is emerging as a driver of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a progressive and fatal disease with limited effective therapies. The senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), involving the release of inflammatory cytokines and profibrotic growth factors by senescent cells, is thought to be a product of multiple cell types in IPF, including lung fibroblasts. NF-?B is a master regulator of the SASP, and its activity depends on the phosphorylation of p65/RelA. The purpose of this study was to assess the role of Pim-1 kinase as a driver of NF-?B-induced production of inflammatory cytokines from low-passage IPF fibroblast cultures displaying markers of senescence. Our results demonstrate that Pim-1 kinase phosphorylates p65/RelA, activating NF-?B activity and enhancing IL-6 production, which in turn amplifies the expression of PIM1, generating a positive feedback loop. In addition, targeting Pim-1 kinase with a small molecule inhibitor dramatically inhibited the expression of a broad array of cytokines and chemokines in IPF-derived fibroblasts. Furthermore, we provide evidence that Pim-1 overexpression in low-passage human lung fibroblasts is sufficient to drive premature senescence, in vitro. These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting Pim-1 kinase to reprogram the secretome of senescent fibroblasts and halt IPF progression.

62,10.1016/j.trf.2022.07.019,Refreshing Older Adults� Driving Skills (ROADSkills): A randomized controlled trial examining the effect of video feedback,"Objectives: This study evaluated the effectiveness of a personalized video-based driver training program on the behind-the-wheel skills of community-dwelling older adults. Method: In this randomized controlled trial (RCT), 80 older drivers [mean age (SD) = 71.0 (3.9)] were randomly assigned to view one of two educational videos: 1) personalized video feedback on their driving (n = 40) or 2) a generic video on aging-in-place (n = 40). The primary outcome, the total number of errors accrued in a 30-minute standardized on-road evaluation, was analyzed at baseline and 4 weeks after watching the assigned video. On-road evaluations were video-recorded and scored by a blinded rater. Self-report measures of driving abilities, behaviors, and comfort were also compared. Results: At the 4-week follow-up, the mean difference in the number of on-road performance errors [mean (95% CI) = -12.0 (-16.6, ?7.4), p < 0.001] favored the intervention group compared to controls, with significant improvements across multiple domains: vehicle control [mean (95% CI) = -4.8 (-8.1, ?1.5), p < 0.01], observing the roadway [mean (95% CI) = -5.5 (-8.4, ?2.6), p < 0.001], and compliance with traffic rules [mean (95% CI) = -1.3 (-2.3, ?0.2), p < 0.05]. Within-group change on behind-the-wheel errors was significant for the intervention group [mean (95% CI) = -10.3 (-13.5, ?7.1), p < 0.001], but not for the control group [mean (95% CI) = 1.7 (-1.6, 4.9), p > 0.05]. No significant differences were found on the self-report measures. Discussion: A novel, video-based approach that provided personalized feedback to older drivers significantly reduced behind-the-wheel errors 4-weeks post-intervention. Changes in self-reported driving behaviors and abilities were not significant. Future research will examine the long-term effects of this approach on older adults� actual and perceived driving abilities. � 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Sangrar R.; Griffith L.E.; Letts L.; Ma J.; Porter M.M.; Vrkljan B.,"Sangrar, Ruheena (56928276300); Griffith, Lauren E.

Methods: Using data from a nationally representative, cross-sectional sample of 4069 U.S. veterans, polynomial regression analyses were conducted to examine changes in self-reported physical, cognitive, and mental health of veterans representing the full age spectrum. Results: Physical health scores were consistently average and stable until around age 80 when they declined. In contrast, cognitive and mental health scores were markedly lower in young veterans and then increased linearly and positively well into late-life. Conclusions: While greater age is associated with relative stability and late-life decline in physical health in U.S. veterans, mental and cognitive health steadily improve until much later in life. Results may help inform age-specific prevention and treatment efforts to promote healthy aging in this population. � 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Overstreet C.; Pietrzak R.H.,"Overstreet, Cassie (50162195300); Pietrzak, Robert H.

64,10.15252/emmm.202216029,In situ mass spectrometry imaging reveals heterogeneous glycogen stores in human normal and cancerous tissues,"Glycogen dysregulation is a hallmark of aging, and aberrant glycogen drives metabolic reprogramming and pathogenesis in multiple diseases. However, glycogen heterogeneity in healthy and diseased tissues remains largely unknown. Herein, we describe a method to define spatial glycogen architecture in mouse and human tissues using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging. This assay provides robust and sensitive spatial glycogen quantification and architecture characterization in the brain, liver, kidney, testis, lung, bladder, and even the bone. Armed with this tool, we interrogated glycogen spatial distribution and architecture in different types of human cancers. We demonstrate that glycogen stores and architecture are heterogeneous among diseases. Additionally, we observe unique hyperphosphorylated glycogen accumulation in Ewing sarcoma, a pediatric bone cancer. Using preclinical models, we correct glycogen hyperphosphorylation in Ewing sarcoma through genetic and pharmacological interventions that ablate in vivo tumor growth, demonstrating the clinical therapeutic potential of targeting glycogen in Ewing sarcoma. � 2022 The Authors.

65,10.1093/ajh/hpac108,Older Adults With Higher Blood Pressure Variability Exhibit Cerebrovascular Reactivity Deficits,"BACKGROUND: Elevated blood pressure (BP) variability is predictive of increased risk for stroke, cerebrovascular disease, and other vascular brain injuries, independent of traditionally studied average BP levels. However, no studies to date have evaluated whether BP variability is related to diminished cerebrovascular reactivity, which may represent an early marker of cerebrovascular dysfunction presaging vascular brain injury. METHODS: The present study investigated BP variability and cerebrovascular reactivity in a sample of 41 community-dwelling older adults (mean age 69.6 [SD 8.7] years) without a history of dementia or stroke. Short-term BP variability was determined from BP measurements collected continuously during a 5-minute resting period followed by cerebrovascular reactivity during 5-minute hypocapnia and hypercapnia challenge induced by visually guided breathing conditions. Cerebrovascular reactivity was quantified as percent change in cerebral perfusion by pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL)-MRI per unit change in end-tidal CO2. RESULTS: Elevated systolic BP variability was related to lower whole brain cerebrovascular reactivity during hypocapnia (? = -0.43 [95% CI -0.73, -0.12]; P = 0.008; adjusted R2 =.11) and hypercapnia (? = -0.42 [95% CI -0.77, -0.06]; P = 0.02; adjusted R2 = 0.19). CONCLUSIONS: Findings add to prior work linking BP variability and cerebrovascular disease burden and suggest BP variability may also be related to prodromal markers of cerebrovascular dysfunction and disease, with potential therapeutic implications. � The Author(s) 2022.

66,10.1016/j.phymed.2022.154181,Berberine-mediated REDD1 down-regulation ameliorates senescence of retinal pigment epithelium by interrupting the ROS-DDR positive feedback loop,"Background: Accumulation of age-associated senescent cells accompanied with increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammatory factors contributes to the progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the main cause of blindness in the elderly. Berberine (BBR) has shown efficacy in the treatment of age-related diseases including diabetes and obesity by decreasing ROS. However, the pharmacological effect of BBR on alleviating retinal aging remains largely unknown. Purpose: Our study aimed to investigate the pharmacological effect of BBR as an anti-aging agent in retinal aging and its further molecular mechanisms. Methods: D-galactose (DG)-induced ARPE-19 cell senescence and retinal aging were employed to evaluate the anti-aging effect of BBR in vivo and in vitro. The siRNA transfection, Western-Blot analyses, SA-?-Gal assay and immunofluorescence were performed to investigate the potential mechanisms of BBR on anti-aging of RPE. Results: In RPE-choroid of both natural aged and DG-induced accelerated aged mice, oxidative stress was increased along with the up-regulation of p21 expression, which was ameliorated by BBR treatment. BBR down-regulated the expression of REDD1 to decrease intracellular ROS content, attenuating DG-induced senescence in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, p53 instead of HIF-1? was identified as the transcriptional regulator of REDD1 in DG-induced premature senescence. Importantly, NAC and BBR reversed the expression of p53 and the content of 8-OHdG, indicating that the positive feedback loop of ROS-DNA damage response (DDR) was formed, and BBR interrupted this feedback loop to alleviate DG-induced premature senescence by reducing REDD1 expression. In addition, BBR restored DG-damaged autophagy flux by up-regulating TFEB-mediated lysosomal biosynthesis by inhibiting REDD1 expression, thereby attenuating cellular senescence. Conclusion: BBR down-regulates REDD1 expression to interrupt the ROS-DDR positive feedback loop and restore autophagic flux, thereby reducing premature senescence of RPE. Our findings elucidate the promising effects of REDD1 on cellular senescence and the great potential of BBR as a therapeutic approach. � 2022",Chen Q.; Xin G.; Li S.; Dong Y.; Yu X.; Wan C.; Wei Z.; Zhu Y.; Zhang K.; Wang Y.; Li F.; Zhang C.; Wen E.; Li Y.; Niu H.; Huang W.,"Chen, Qingqiu (57204514972); Xin, Guang (57647222600); Li, Shiyi (57201279479); Dong, Yuman (57387353700); Yu, Xiuxian (57386798500); Wan, Chengyu (57387544500); Wei, Zeliang (56154713600); Zhu, Yuda (57643526300); Zhang, Kun (57386240700); Wang, Yilan (57647963400); Li, Fan (57644996300); Zhang, Cuicui (57751988200); Wen, E.

67,10.1109/TDEI.2022.3190805,Influence of Nanoparticles on Long-Term Thermal Stability of Vegetable Insulating Oil,"Although vegetable oil is the best substitute for mineral oil, it exhibits numerous disadvantages, including a high dielectric loss factor, low volume resistivity, and high viscosity. Nanoparticle modification may improve the electrical properties of vegetable oil considerably. In this study, vegetable oil infused with Fe3O4, TiO2, and Al2O3 nanoparticles was investigated. Thermal aging experiments were performed at 100 ?C, 130 ?C, and 150 ?C. The aged vegetable insulating oil was periodically sampled and tested. The results revealed that the nanoparticles with a mass fraction of 0.001% exhibited the best modification effect. The electrical properties of the vegetable insulating oil modified with magnetic nanoparticles were pronounced, whereas the modification effect of nonmagnetic nanoparticles was mild. The general trend of the modification effect of the nanoparticles on vegetable oil became obvious with the increase in the temperature. At the same content, the modification effect of nano-Fe3O4 was superior to that of nano-TiO2 and nano-Al2O3. The results of this study provide experimental and theoretical support for the mechanism of long-term stability of vegetable insulating oil with nanoparticles and can be used to improve the long-term stability of vegetable insulating oil.  � 1994-2012 IEEE.",Cong H.; Shao H.; Du Y.; Hu X.; Zhao W.; Li Q.,"Cong, Haoxi (55286089000); Shao, Huiming (57609673300); Du, Yulin (57609673200); Hu, Xuefeng (55927489900); Zhao, Weijia (56038944300); Li, Qingmin (57831585100)",55286089000; 57609673300; 57609673200; 55927489900; 56038944300; 57831585100,2022,IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation,29,5,,1642,1650,8,0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134262943&doi=10.1109%2fTDEI.2022.3190805&partnerID=40&md5=2469bb7d9922d3c073fd2a3051ed9c54,Dielectric losses; Nanomagnetics; Oil filled transformers; Power transformers; Thermal aging; Thermal insulation; Thermodynamic stability; Vegetable oils; %moisture; Dielectric loss factors; High dielectrics; High viscosities; Long term stability; Modification effect; Oil insulations; Power transformer insulation; Vegetable insulating oil; Volume resistivity; Nanoparticles,Long-term stability; nanoparticle; thermal aging; vegetable insulating oil,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85134262943,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
68,10.3390/polym14235246,Impact of Non-Accelerated Aging on the Properties of Parylene C,"The polymer Parylene combines a variety of excellent properties and, hence, is an object of intensive research for packaging applications, such as the direct encapsulation of medical implants. Moreover, in the past years, an increasing interest for establishing new applications for Parylene is observed. These include the usage of Parylene as a flexible substrate, a dielectric, or a material for MEMS, e.g., a bonding adhesive. The increasing importance of Parylene raises questions regarding the long-term reliability and aging of Parylene as well as the impact of the aging on the Parylene properties. Within this paper, we present the first investigations on non-accelerated Parylene C aging for a period of about five years. Doing so, free-standing Parylene membranes were fabricated to investigate the barrier properties, the chemical stability, as well as the optical properties of Parylene in dependence on different post-treatments to the polymer. These properties were found to be excellent and with only a minor age-related impact.

69,10.1016/j.pnpbp.2023.110721,"The shared molecular mechanisms underlying aging of the brain, major depressive disorder, and Alzheimer's disease: The role of circadian rhythm disturbances","An association with circadian clock function and pathophysiology of aging, major depressive disorder (MDD), and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is well established and has been proposed as a factor in the development of these diseases. Depression and changes in circadian rhythm have been increasingly suggested as the two primary overlapping and interpenetrating changes that occur with aging. The relationship between AD and depression in late life is not completely understood and probably is complex. Patients with major depression or AD suffer from disturbed sleep/wake cycles and altered rhythms in daily activities. Although classical monoaminergic hypotheses are traditionally proposed to explain the pathophysiology of MDD, several clinical and preclinical studies have reported a strong association between circadian rhythm and mood regulation. In addition, a large body of evidence supports an association between disruption of circadian rhythm and AD. Some clock genes are dysregulated in rodent models of depression. If aging, AD, and MDD share a common biological basis in pathophysiology, common therapeutic tools could be investigated for their prevention and treatment. Nitro-oxidative stress (NOS), for example, plays a fundamental role in aging, as well as in the pathogenesis of AD and MDD and is associated with circadian clock disturbances. Thus, development of therapeutic possibilities with these NOS-related conditions is advisable. This review describes recent findings that link disrupted circadian clocks to aging, MDD, and AD and summarizes the experimental evidence that supports connections between the circadian clock and molecular pathologic factors as shared common pathophysiological mechanisms underlying aging, AD, and MDD. � 2023 Elsevier Inc.",Amidfar M.; Garcez M.L.; Kim Y.-K.,"Amidfar, Meysam (56040892800); Garcez, Michelle Lima (55949881900); Kim, Yong-Ku (57824411800)",56040892800; 55949881900; 57824411800,2023,Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry,123,,110721,,,,0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85147204035&doi=10.1016%2fj.pnpbp.2023.110721&partnerID=40&md5=3430a68e82ca9b42baf0325bd2853c6f,"Alzheimer Disease; Brain; Circadian Rhythm; Depressive Disorder, Major; Humans; aging; Alzheimer disease; astrocyte; autophagy (cellular); brain; cell function; circadian rhythm; disease association; human; major depression; molecular clock; molecular mechanics; nerve degeneration; nervous system inflammation; nonhuman; oxidative stress; pathophysiology; Review; suprachiasmatic nucleus; Alzheimer disease; brain; circadian rhythm; major depression; physiology",Aging; Alzheimer's disease; Circadian clock; Major depression; Oxidative stress,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85147204035,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,
70,10.1186/s12877-022-03345-4,The use of co-design in developing physical activity interventions for older adults: a scoping review,"Background: Promoting physical activity (PA) participation in older adults is important for preserving quality of life and functional independence. Co-design has been shown to increase engagement of end-users in health-related policies and interventions. This scoping review aimed to examine how co-design has been used to develop PA interventions for older adults. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, and CINAHL. Peer-reviewed primary research studies that met the following criteria were included: had at least one participant aged ?60 years involved in the co-design process and the intervention was delivered to individuals whose mean age was ?60, used co-design methodologies, and any form of PA. After duplicate removal, two or more independent reviewers completed title and abstract and full text screening. Data were extracted from the included studies according to study aims. Results: Of the 29 included studies, 12 different terms were used to describe co-design with variable operational definitions that we consolidated into five proposed components. Fifteen studies engaged users in a consultative way, 13 studies using collaboration, and one study engaged end-users in consumer-control. No studies involved end-users in the dissemination phase. Further, no studies directly measured the effectiveness of the co-design process. Five categories of barriers and facilitators to co-design were identified including frameworks and methodologies, logistics, relationships, participation, and generalizability. Conclusions: There is a large degree of variability in how co-design is used to develop PA interventions for older adults. Our findings can be used by researchers to improve rigor and standardization in this emerging field.

The hazards posed by these fires increase significantly when they approach the wild�urban interface, with relevant environmental and socio-economic consequences. The 2009 Victorian bushfires and the 2017 Portugal wildfires are powerful reminders, and they have demonstrated the need to better understand why mitigation plans have failed to protect the community in these events and to improve community resilience. The year 2017 is a milestone in the history of wildfires in Portugal, not only because of the vast burned area but also due to the high number of fatalities. The two occurrences were at different times (June and October) but were geographically close (region of centre of Portugal). A total of 117 deaths occurred in both events and 92% of the victims were in wild�urban interface areas. This paper analyses and discusses the characteristics and causes of death of the victims of these two events: age, place of death, distance from place of death to place of residence and last-minute choices to aim to understand the actions that people took in the face of the approaching fire, which led to their death. In both cases, most people died fleeing the fire without any information from the competent authorities. In the end, it is possible to identify risk factors that lead to the death of civilians due to wildfires, such as the increase in demand for rurality by young people from big cities with no previous contact with wildfires; on the other hand, there is the ageing of the population residing in forest areas, who were previously physically and structurally prepared to deal with fires and are currently no longer able to. � 2022 by the authors.",Rodrigues A.; Santiago A.; La�m L.; Viegas D.X.; Z�zere J.L.,"Rodrigues, Andreia (58033062400); Santiago, Aldina (9942423100); La�m, Lu�s (35327263900); Viegas, Domingos Xavier (56230781800); Z�zere, Jos� Lu�s (6507109389)",58033062400; 9942423100; 35327263900; 56230781800; 6507109389,2022,Applied Sciences (Switzerland),12,24,12561,,,,0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85144889533&doi=10.3390%2fapp122412561&partnerID=40&md5=cf2c67119b0fb243394fc41bbbc72944,,Portugal wildfires; risk factors; self-evacuation; victims; wildfires,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85144889533,1,0,0,Portugal,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,117,1,0,0,0,NA,NA,

It involves in cellular metabolism, aging, and immune response. Recently oxidative stress has been proved about its beneficial roles in human body. However, long term oxidative stress and high concentration of free radicals can lead to negative effects on organs, systems, and physiological conditions. Prooxidant or antioxidant, therefore, is one of the most important choices for the prevention of these anomaly. Tamarindus indica is a medicinal plant that has been reported as a source of antioxidants. The plants' leaves possess antioxidant effects according to many studies. However, these results have not yet been systematically summarized. The present systematic review summarizes and discusses about the in vitro antioxidant capacities of T. indica leaves.

In order to propagate at a specific interface and not cohesively, a specific specimen was developed, based on a modification of the Tapered Double Cantilever Beam (TDCB) specimen. In particular, the dimensions of one substrate were reduced to create an asymmetry in the specimen and drive the propagation path towards one interface. The authors present experimental results showing repetitive interfacial failures and a procedure to evaluate the SERR. The non-linear behaviour responsible of non-linear deformation in the substrate was taken into account in the calculations of the SERR. Through a numerical inverse method using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and Cohezive Zone Modelling (CZM), the SERR was calculated for an epoxy based structural adhesive at the interface with a stainless-steel substrate. Then, the procedure was carried out to measure the interfacial SERR after different ageing times. � 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Leplat J.; Stamoulis G.; Bidaud P.; Th�venet D.,"Leplat, Johnatan (57218991545); Stamoulis, Georgios (56096087300); Bidaud, Pierre (56654995400); Th�venet, David (8214263300)",57218991545; 56096087300; 56654995400; 8214263300,2022,Theoretical and Applied Fracture Mechanics,121,,103511,,,,0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135130415&doi=10.1016%2fj.tafmec.2022.103511&partnerID=40&md5=7770ae9a21ef7146eb583418266d9913,Adhesive joints; Cantilever beams; Energy release rate; Failure (mechanical); Fracture mechanics; Inverse problems; Metal substrates; Numerical methods; Strain energy; Strain rate; Adhesively bonded structures; Double-cantilever beam; Experimental; Fractures mechanics; Interfacial strain; Measurements of; Metallic substrate; Specific interface; Strain energy release rate; Water aging; Adhesives,Adhesive; Experimental; Fracture mechanics; Interface; Water ageing,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85135130415,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dynamic ?AC susceptibility measurements have revealed the existence of dissipation at Tg = 18 K, which is associated to the spin freezing transition, for all the ensembles. Besides, the superantiferromagnetic ensembles (?D?? 24 nm) also showcase a dissipation contribution close to the vicinity of the N�el transition, TN = 40.2 K. This dissipation, which takes the form of two humps located at Td1 = 33.5(5) K and Td2 = 40.0(5) K, is associated to uncompensated antiferromagnetic moments. Time-dependent phenomena (ageing and memory effects) are only evidenced below the spin freezing transition, evidencing that solely this low-temperature disordered phase is driven by the frustration of RKKY exchange interactions. Consequently, GdCu2 nanoparticles display a dual disorder-driven magnetic dynamics, which are the one ascribed to the magnetically frustrated moments located at the nanoparticle surface; and that of uncompensated antiferromagnetic moments located within the nanoparticle core. � 2022, The Author(s).",Jefremovas E.M.; Svedlindh P.; Barqu�n L.F.,"Jefremovas, Elizabeth M (57211004033); Svedlindh, Peter (7006347551); Barqu�n, Luis Fern�ndez (7004352500)",57211004033; 7006347551; 7004352500,2022,Journal of Nanoparticle Research,24,10,194,,,,0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138394622&doi=10.1007%2fs11051-022-05574-5&partnerID=40&md5=cca23b0d1545cadf974dd64e20540d1b,Antiferromagnetism; Binary alloys; Copper alloys; Freezing; Gadolinium alloys; Magnetic susceptibility; Nanomagnetics; Temperature; A.C. susceptibility; Ageing effects; Antiferromagnetic moment; Freezing transition; Frustrated magnetisms; Magnetic dynamics; Nanoparticle sizes; Spin freezing; Susceptibility measurements; Time dependent phenomena; Spin dynamics,Antiferromagnetism; Frustrated magnetism; Magnetic nanoparticles; Spin dynamics,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85138394622,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77,10.1186/s12859-022-04841-5,Identification and validation of a siglec-based and aging-related 9-gene signature for predicting prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia patients,"Background: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a group of highly heterogenous and aggressive blood cancer. Despite recent progress in its diagnosis and treatment, patient outcome is variable and drug resistance results in increased mortality. The siglec family plays an important role in tumorigenesis and aging. Increasing age is a risk factor for AML and cellular aging contributes to leukemogenesis via various pathways. Methods: The differential expression of the siglec family was compared between 151 AML patients and 70 healthy controls, with their information downloaded from TCGA and GTEx databases, respectively. How siglec expression correlated to AML patient clinical features, immune cell infiltration, drug resistance and survival outcome was analyzed. Differentially expressed genes in AML patients with low- and high-expressed siglec9 and siglec14 were analyzed and functionally enriched. The aging-related gene set was merged with the differentially expressed genes in AML patients with low and high expression of siglec9, and merged genes were subjected to lasso regression analysis to construct a novel siglec-based and aging-related prognostic model. The prediction model was validated using a validation cohort from GEO database (GSE106291). Results: The expression levels of all siglec members were significantly altered in AML. The expression of siglecs was significantly correlated with AML patient clinical features, immune cell infiltration, drug resistance, and survival outcome. Based on the differentially expressed genes and aging-related gene set, we developed a 9-gene prognostic model and decision curve analysis revealed the net benefit generated by our prediction model. The siglec-based and aging-related 9-gene prognostic model was tested using a validation data set, in which AML patients with higher risk scores had significantly reduced survival probability. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve and nomogram were plotted and showed the diagnostic accuracy and predictive value of our 9-gene prognostic model, respectively. Conclusions: Overall, our study indicates the important role of siglec family in AML and the good performance of our novel siglec-based and aging-related 9-gene signature in predicting AML patient outcome. � 2022, The Author(s).",Shi H.; Gao L.; Zhang W.; Jiang M.,"Shi, Huiping (57808489400); Gao, Liang (57194583131); Zhang, Weili (56227660800); Jiang, Min (57190276167)",57808489400; 57194583131; 56227660800; 57190276167,2022,BMC Bioinformatics,23,1,284,,,,2,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134366369&doi=10.1186%2fs12859-022-04841-5&partnerID=40&md5=782a6234f28ddf2e9d4364edcc87d9cf,"Antigens, CD; Cohort Studies; Humans; Lectins; Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute; Receptors, Cell Surface; ROC Curve; Sialic Acid Binding Immunoglobulin-like Lectins; Diagnosis; Diseases; Forecasting; Regression analysis; cell surface receptor; lectin; leukocyte antigen; sialic acid binding immunoglobulin like lectin; SIGLEC14 protein, human; SIGLEC9 protein, human; Acute myeloid leukemia; Cancer genome; Clinical features; Differentially expressed gene; Drug-resistance; Gene signatures; Immune cells; Prognostic modeling; Siglecs; The cancer genome atlas; acute myeloid leukemia; cohort analysis; genetics; human; receiver operating characteristic; Genes",Acute myeloid leukemia; Aging; Drug resistance; Prognostic model; Siglec; The cancer genome atlas,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85134366369,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,"221 (151 patients, 70 controls)",0,0,0,0,NA,NA,

79,10.1177/00380261221144154,"The social connectedness of digital practices in later life: It�s not just about learning, it�s all about relationships","In the last 10 years there has been an increase in access to information and communication technologies among older people, stimulated by widespread adoption of mobile devices (smartphones and tablets). At the same time, digital inclusion policies and training programmes continue to develop to increase the access to the digital society for this social group. In this context, it is pertinent to revisit a long-standing research question about how older adults use and learn to use these technologies in their everyday lives while paying attention to how their subjectivities and their knowledge are situated in the collective shared knowledge of digital practices. Using examples taken from a digital team ethnographic study exploring social media use in later life, this article delves into how learning digital practices and affective relations assemble and what they do to older people�s subjectivities. Their engagements show how these practices are illustrative of the relevance of social connectivity, place, things and affects for learning how to use ICTs. We, then, move to discuss the policy implications of this for the understandings of ageing within a digital society. � The Author(s) 2023.",Beneito-Montagut R.; Begueria A.; Cassi�n N.,"Beneito-Montagut, Roser (26421900900); Begueria, Arantza (57197754623); Cassi�n, Nizai� (58091881200)",26421900900; 57197754623; 58091881200,2023,Sociological Review,,,,,,,0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85147454009&doi=10.1177%2f00380261221144154&partnerID=40&md5=cdcb1643e9683e1eeed347f8a2b6487c,,affects; digital technologies; older people; relationality; social connectedness,Article,Article in press,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85147454009,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,
80,10.1002/aic.18020,An integrated chemical engineering approach to understanding microplastics,"Environmental and health risks posed by microplastics (MPs) have spurred numerous studies to better understand MPs' properties and behavior. Yet, we still lack a comprehensive understanding due to MP's heterogeneity in properties and complexity of plastic property evolution during aging processes. There is an urgent need to thoroughly understand the properties and behavior of MPs as there is increasing evidence of MPs' adverse health and environmental effects. In this perspective, we propose an integrated chemical engineering approach to improve our understanding of MPs. The approach merges artificial intelligence, theoretical methods, and experimental techniques to integrate existing data into models of MPs, investigate unknown features of MPs, and identify future areas of research. The breadth of chemical engineering, which spans biological, computational, and materials sciences, makes it well-suited to comprehensively characterize MPs. Ultimately, this perspective charts a path for cross-disciplinary collaborative research in chemical engineering to address the issue of MP pollution. � 2023 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.",Bang R.S.; Bergman M.; Li T.; Mukherjee F.; Alshehri A.S.; Abbott N.L.; Crook N.C.; Velev O.D.; Hall C.K.; You F.,"Bang, Rachel S.

81,10.1161/JAHA.122.026143,Renin-Angiotensin System Inhibitors in Patients With COVID-19: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials Led by the International Society of Hypertension,"BACKGROUND: Published randomized controlled trials are underpowered for binary clinical end points to assess the safety and efficacy of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RASi) in adults with COVID-19. We therefore performed a meta-analysis to assess the safety and efficacy of RASi in adults with COVID-19. METHODS AND RESULTS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Clini?calTr?ials.gov, and the Cochrane Controlled Trial Register were searched for randomized controlled trials that randomly assigned patients with COVID-19 to RASi continuation/commencement versus no RASi therapy. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at ?30 days. A total of 14 randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria and enrolled 1838 participants (aged 59 years, 58% men, mean follow-up 26 days). Of the trials, 11 contributed data. We found no effect of RASi versus control on all-cause mortality (7.2% versus 7.5%; relative risk [RR], 0.95; [95% CI, 0.69�1.30]) either overall or in subgroups defined by COVID-19 severity or trial type. Network meta-analysis identified no difference between angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors versus angiotensin II receptor blockers. RASi users had a nonsignificant reduction in acute myocardial infarction (2.1% versus 3.6%; RR, 0.59; [95% CI, 0.33�1.06]), but increased risk of acute kidney injury (7.0% versus 3.6%; RR, 1.82; [95% CI, 1.05� 3.16]), in trials that initiated and continued RASi. There was no increase in need for dialysis or differences in congestive cardiac failure, cerebrovascular events, venous thromboembolism, hospitalization, intensive care admission, inotropes, or mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials evaluating angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angio-tensin II receptor blockers versus control in patients with COVID-19 found no difference in all-cause mortality, a borderline decrease in myocardial infarction, and an increased risk of acute kidney injury with RASi. Our findings provide strong evidence that RASi can be used safely in patients with COVID-19. � 2022 The Authors.",Gnanenthiran S.R.; Borghi C.; Burger D.; Caramelli B.; Charchar F.; Chirinos J.A.; Cohen J.B.; Cremer A.; Di Tanna G.L.; Duvignaud A.; Freilich D.; Gommans D.H.F.; Gracia-Ramos A.E.; Murray T.A.; Pelorosso F.; Poulter N.R.; Puskarich M.A.; Rizas K.D.; Rothlin R.; Schlaich M.P.; Schreinlecher M.; Steckelings U.M.; Sharma A.; Stergiou G.S.; Tignanelli C.J.; Tomaszewski M.; Unger T.; van Kimmenade R.R.J.; Wainford R.D.; Williams B.; Rodgers A.; Schutte A.E.,"Gnanenthiran, Sonali R.

82,10.1111/brv.12879,A reaction norm framework for the evolution of learning: how cumulative experience shapes phenotypic plasticity,"Learning is a familiar process to most people, but it currently lacks a fully developed theoretical position within evolutionary biology. Learning (memory and forgetting) involves adjustments in behaviour in response to cumulative sequences of prior experiences or exposures to environmental cues. We therefore suggest that all forms of learning (and some similar biological phenomena in development, aging, acquired immunity and acclimation) can usefully be viewed as special cases of phenotypic plasticity, and formally modelled by expanding the concept of reaction norms to include additional environmental dimensions quantifying sequences of cumulative experience (learning) and the time delays between events (forgetting). Memory therefore represents just one of a number of different internal neurological, physiological, hormonal and anatomical �states� that mediate the carry-over effects of cumulative environmental experiences on phenotypes across different time periods. The mathematical and graphical conceptualisation of learning as plasticity within a reaction norm framework can easily accommodate a range of different ecological scenarios, closely linking statistical estimates with biological processes. Learning and non-learning plasticity interact whenever cumulative prior experience causes a modification in the reaction norm (a) elevation [mean phenotype], (b) slope [responsiveness], (c) environmental estimate error [informational memory] and/or (d) phenotypic precision [skill acquisition]. Innovation and learning new contingencies in novel (laboratory) environments can also be accommodated within this approach. A common reaction norm approach should thus encourage productive cross-fertilisation of ideas between traditional studies of learning and phenotypic plasticity. As an example, we model the evolution of plasticity with and without learning under different levels of environmental estimation error to show how learning works as a specific adaptation promoting phenotypic plasticity in temporally autocorrelated environments. Our reaction norm framework for learning and analogous biological processes provides a conceptual and mathematical structure aimed at usefully stimulating future theoretical and empirical investigations into the evolution of plasticity across a wider range of ecological contexts, while providing new interdisciplinary connections regarding learning mechanisms. � 2022 The Authors.

83,10.1089/lgbt.2020.0505,Distribution and Prevalence of Health in a National Probability Sample of Three Cohorts of Sexual Minority Adults in the United States,"Purpose: This study examined the health profile of a national probability sample of three cohorts of sexual minority people, and the ways that indicators of health vary among sexual minority people across age cohorts and other defining sociodemographic characteristics, including sexual identity, gender identity, and race/ethnicity. Methods: The Generations Study, the first national probability sample of three age cohorts of sexual minority people (n = 1507) in the United States collected in 2016-2017, was used to examine general health profiles across several broad domains: alcohol and drug abuse; general health, physical health, and health disability; mental health and psychological distress; and positive well-being, including general happiness, social well-being, and life satisfaction. Results: There were no cohort differences in substance abuse or positive well-being. The younger cohort was physically healthier, but had worse psychological health than both the middle and older cohorts. Conclusions: Cohort differences in physical health were consistent with patterns of aging, whereas for mental health, there were distinct cohort differences among sexual minority people. Given that compromised mental health in the early life course creates trajectories of vulnerability, these results point to the need for mental health prevention and intervention for younger cohorts of sexual minority people.  � Copyright 2022, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2022.",Russell S.T.; Mallory A.B.; Fish J.N.; Frost D.M.; Hammack P.L.; Lightfoot M.; Lin A.; Wilson B.D.M.; Meyer I.H.,"Russell, Stephen T.

However, gauging age-appropriate neural development remains a difficult task due to the constantly changing appearance of the fetal brain, variable image quality, and frequent motion artifacts. Here we present an end-to-end, attention-guided deep learning model that predicts gestational age with R2 score of 0.945, mean absolute error of 6.7�days, and concordance correlation coefficient of 0.970. The convolutional neural network was trained on a heterogeneous dataset of 741 developmentally normal fetal brain images ranging from 19 to 39�weeks in gestational age. We also demonstrate model performance and generalizability using independent datasets from four academic institutions across the U.S. and Turkey with R2 scores of 0.81�0.90 after minimal fine-tuning. The proposed regression algorithm provides an automated machine-enabled tool with the potential to better characterize in utero neurodevelopment and guide real-time gestational age estimation after the first trimester. � 2022, The Author(s).",Shen L.; Zheng J.; Lee E.H.; Shpanskaya K.; McKenna E.S.; Atluri M.G.; Plasto D.; Mitchell C.; Lai L.M.; Guimaraes C.V.; Dahmoush H.; Chueh J.; Halabi S.S.; Pauly J.M.; Xing L.; Lu Q.; Oztekin O.; Kline-Fath B.M.; Yeom K.W.,"Shen, Liyue (57201327444); Zheng, Jimmy (57216683720); Lee, Edward H.

While the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood, it is documented that lncRNAs may play key roles. Many HCC-associated lncRNAs have been linked to HBV and HCV infection, mediating gene expression, cell growth, development, and death. Studying the regulatory mechanisms and biological functions of HCC-related lncRNAs will assist our understanding of HCC pathogenesis as well as its diagnosis and management. Here, we address the potential of dysregulated lncRNAs in HCC as diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers, and we evaluate the oncogenic or tumor-suppressive properties of these lncRNAs.

86,10.1016/j.porgcoat.2022.107119,Interfacial polarization suppression of P(VDF-HFP) film through 2D montmorillonite nanosheets coating,"Polymer based dielectrics with excellent high electric field withstanding capability are of great significance for enhancing the power density and payload efficiency for both electrical and electronic systems. However, polymer-metal interface is prone to defect formation, leading to the dielectric aging and the initialization of electrical breakdown failure. A facile Montmorillonite (MMT) coating is self-co-assembled on the surface of P(VDF-HFP) high-k film to form hundreds of 2D nanosheets layers to impede the charge injection over the metal-polymer interface. The MMT coating increases the breakdown strength of the P(VDF-HFP) co-polymer film from 405 to 452 MV/m. The high field conduction study reveals a highly enhanced Schottky injection barrier that blocks the charge injection from electrodes to polymer bulk, leading to significantly suppressed charge injection and conduction loss in polymer. In addition, the introduction of MMT layered coating leads to prominent suppression of interfacial polarization loss, a phenomenon known as the blocking capacitance, which would otherwise stem from the accumulated charges of polymer-metal interface, by one order of magnitude, as demonstrated by the dielectric response analysis by using the Dissado-Hill model over a broad range of temperature and frequency. The superior charge injection and interfacial polarization suppression via the application of MMT coating impart the P(VDF-HFP) co-polymer film with higher breakdown strength, and provides an effective approach to develop high performance polymer dielectrics by interfacial engineering. This work provides insights into the understanding of the enhancement mechanism of 2D coating. � 2022",Wang Q.; Wu C.; LaChance A.M.; Zhou J.; Gao Y.; Zhang Y.; Sun L.; Cao Y.; Liang X.,"Wang, Qian (57203733104); Wu, Chao (56714002300); LaChance, Anna Marie (57205677207); Zhou, Jierui (57192666213); Gao, Yanfeng (56003851200); Zhang, Yunxiao (56084227500); Sun, Luyi (10839207900); Cao, Yang (56447401800); Liang, Xidong (7401735782)",57203733104; 56714002300; 57205677207; 57192666213; 56003851200; 56084227500; 10839207900; 56447401800; 7401735782,2022,Progress in Organic Coatings,172,,107119,,,,1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136093802&doi=10.1016%2fj.porgcoat.2022.107119&partnerID=40&md5=a699992b4eca7164a20018b8cfe17e43,Clay minerals; Electric breakdown; High-k dielectric; Nanosheets; Plastic coatings; Polarization; Semiconducting films; 2d coating; Breakdown strengths; Co-polymers; Dielectric response; High-field conduction; Interfacial polarization; P(VDF-HFP); Polarization suppression; Polymer based; Polymer/metal interfaces; Polymer films,2D coating; Dielectric film; Dielectric response; High field conduction; Interfacial polarization; P(VDF-HFP),Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85136093802,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
87,10.1002/jcp.30969,The miR-181 family: Wide-ranging pathophysiological effects on cell fate and function,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are epigenetic regulators that can target and inhibit translation of multiple mRNAs within a given cell type. As such, a number of different pathways and networks may be modulated as a result. In fact, miRNAs are known to regulate many cellular processes including differentiation, proliferation, inflammation, and metabolism. This review focuses on the miR-181 family and provides information from the published literature on the role of miR-181 homologs in regulating a range of activities in different cell types and tissues. Of note, we have not included details on miR-181 expression and function in the context of cancer since this is a broad topic area requiring independent review. Instead, we have focused on describing the function and mechanism of miR-181 family members on differentiation toward a number of cell lineages in various non-neoplastic conditions (e.g., immune/hematopoietic cells, osteoblasts, osteoclasts, chondrocytes, adipocytes). We have also provided information on how modulation of miR-181 homologs can have positive effects on disease states such as cardiac abnormalities, pulmonary arterial hypertension, thrombosis, osteoarthritis, and vascular inflammation. In this context, we have used some examples of FDA-approved drugs that modulate miR-181 expression. We conclude by discussing some common mechanisms by which miR-181 homologs appear to regulate a number of different cellular processes and how targeting specific miR-181 family members may lead to attractive therapeutic approaches to treat a number of human disease or repair conditions, including those associated with the aging process. � 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",Bell-Hensley A.; Das S.; McAlinden A.,"Bell-Hensley, Austin (57965322400); Das, Samarjit (55477006100); McAlinden, Audrey (6602911329)",57965322400; 55477006100; 6602911329,2023,Journal of Cellular Physiology,,,,,,,0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85148018040&doi=10.1002%2fjcp.30969&partnerID=40&md5=004dc01a96fdc9fb633b2b31a93dabb8,,cardiovascular; cell differentiation; microRNA; miR-181; miR-181 family; musculoskeletal,Review,Article in press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85148018040,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,
88,10.3390/ijms23179785,Role of Muscle LIM Protein in Mechanotransduction Process,"The induction of protein synthesis is crucial to counteract the deconditioning of neuromuscular system and its atrophy. In the past, hormones and cytokines acting as growth factors involved in the intracellular events of these processes have been identified, while the implications of signaling pathways associated with the anabolism/catabolism ratio in reference to the molecular mechanism of skeletal muscle hypertrophy have been recently identified. Among them, the mechanotransduction resulting from a mechanical stress applied to the cell appears increasingly interesting as a potential pathway for therapeutic intervention. At present, there is an open question regarding the type of stress to apply in order to induce anabolic events or the type of mechanical strain with respect to the possible mechanosensing and mechanotransduction processes involved in muscle cells protein synthesis. This review is focused on the muscle LIM protein (MLP), a structural and mechanosensing protein with a LIM domain, which is expressed in the sarcomere and costamere of striated muscle cells. It acts as a transcriptional cofactor during cell proliferation after its nuclear translocation during the anabolic process of differentiation and rebuilding. Moreover, we discuss the possible opportunity of stimulating this mechanotransduction process to counteract the muscle atrophy induced by anabolic versus catabolic disorders coming from the environment, aging or myopathies. � 2022 by the authors.",Germain P.; Delalande A.; Pichon C.,"Germain, Philippe (35822302100); Delalande, Anthony (35232961800); Pichon, Chantal (7004581546)",35822302100; 35232961800; 7004581546,2022,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,23,17,9785,,,,0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137599258&doi=10.3390%2fijms23179785&partnerID=40&md5=277d7a0b889c7e224b40c5fc2d754d17,cell protein; cytokine; growth factor; LIM protein; transcription factor; biosynthesis; cell differentiation; cell plasticity; cell proliferation; costamere; extracellular matrix; human; mechanical stress; mechanosensing; mechanotransduction; muscle atrophy; muscle strain; muscle stress; myopathy; nonhuman; protein domain; Review; sarcomere; signal transduction; striated muscle; striated muscle cell,atrophy; mechanotransduction; MLP; prophylaxis; striated muscle; ultrasound stimulation,Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85137599258,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,

Methods: The study selected two comparison groups. Comparison A consisted of a non-exposed group born between 1963-1965 from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) 2015 wave (N=862) and a fetal-exposed group born between 1959-1961 from the 2011 wave (N=507). Comparison B consisted of an early childhood-exposed group born between 1955-1957 from the 2011 wave (N=830) and a fetal-exposed group born between 1959-1961 from the 2015 wave (N=552). Multivariable logistic regressions were conducted to explore the associations between different periods of famine exposure and obesity, metabolic health status, and metabolic obesity phenotypes, with stratification by sex. Results: Compared with the non-exposed group, participants exposed to famine in the fetal period had a significantly lower risk of overweight/obesity (OR: 0.78, 95%CI: 0.63-0.97) and a higher risk of metabolically unhealthy status (OR: 1.73, 95%CI: 1.34-2.23) and metabolically unhealthy non-obesity (MUNO) (OR: 2.12, 95%CI: 1.46-3.08) at the age of 50-52 years. In the sex-stratified analysis, males exposed to famine in the fetal period had a significantly lower risk of overweight/obesity (OR: 0.59, 95%CI: 0.43-0.80) and metabolically healthy obesity (MHO) (OR: 0.56, 95%CI: 0.37-0.85), while such associations were not found in females. Compared with the early childhood exposure group, participants in the fetal exposure group had a significantly lower risk of metabolic unhealthy status (OR: 0.65, 95%CI: 0.51-0.85) and MUNO (OR: 0.50, 95%CI: 0.35-0.72). Those associations were observed in both males and females. Conclusion: Exposure to famine in early life increased the risk of metabolically unhealthy status in adulthood. Different metabolic subtypes should be identified at an early stage and followed by classification, intervention, and treatment.

Although SE impacts informal caregivers� subjective well-being, its effects have not yet been studied from the perspective of telecare use. This study aimed to explore informal caregivers� perceptions of and associations between SE and subjective well-being when using different telecare functionalities. Methods: A four-month intervention study using a qualitative research design was conducted. In-depth interviews were conducted with 22 informal caregivers of older people who tested one of two telecare devices in their homes. Results: Five task-specific dimensions of caregiver SE were identified that were shaped by telecare use: controlling upsetting thoughts about the care recipient, managing protective vigilance, obtaining support in emergency situations, managing caregiving, work, family life, and responding in a timely manner to changes in the care recipient�s daily routine. These SE dimensions were associated with caregivers� subjective well-being. Conclusions: Telecare use may contribute to greater caregiver SE and higher subjective well-being. Therefore, future studies should pay more attention to these potential benefits of telecare. Additional dimensions of caregiver SE should be included in existing caregiver SE scales when examining caregiver SE related to telecare use. � 2022 by the authors.",Hvali?-Touzery S.; Smole-Orehek K.; Dolni?ar V.,"Hvali?-Touzery, Simona (56073838200); Smole-Orehek, Kaja (57208082746); Dolni?ar, Vesna (8290651400)",56073838200; 57208082746; 8290651400,2022,Geriatrics (Switzerland),7,5,86,,,,1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85140581755&doi=10.3390%2fgeriatrics7050086&partnerID=40&md5=d2dff5281ca83a18e539c3f80c434fa1,adult; aging; alertness; article; assistive technology; attention; care behavior; caregiver; emotional well-being; family life; home environment; home monitoring; human; intervention study; interview; perception; qualitative research; self concept; telecare,aging society; assistive technologies; home monitoring devices; informal caregiving for older people; self-efficacy dimensions; subjective well-being,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85140581755,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,22,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,
91,10.1038/s41598-022-12742-z,How social/environmental determinants and inflammation affect salivary telomere length among middle-older adults in the health and retirement study,"Social epidemiology posits that chronic stress from social determinants will lead to a prolonged inflammatory response that may induce accelerated aging as measured, for example, through telomere length (TL). In this paper, we hypothesize variables across demographic, health-related, and contextual/environmental domains influence the body�s stress response, increase inflammation (as measured through high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP)), and thereby lead to shortening of telomeres. This population-based research uses data from the 2008 Health and Retirement Study on participants ages ? 54�95 + years, estimating logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models of variables (with and without confounders) across the domains on shortened TL. A mediation analysis is also conducted. Contrary to expectations, hs-CRP is not associated with risk of shortened TL. Rather, factors related to accessing health care, underlying conditions of frailty, and social inequality appear to predict risk of shorter TL, and models demonstrate considerable confounding. Further, hs-CRP is not a mediator for TL. Therefore, the social determinants of health examined do not appear to follow an inflammatory pathway for shortened TL. The finding of a relationship to social determinants affecting access to health care and medical conditions underscores the need to address social determinants alongside primary care when examining health inequities. � 2022, The Author(s).",Courtney M.G.; Roberts J.; Godde K.,"Courtney, Margaret Gough (57420559000); Roberts, Josephine (57709772800); Godde, Kanya (24831960100)",57420559000; 57709772800; 24831960100,2022,Scientific Reports,12,1,8882,,,,0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130704161&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-022-12742-z&partnerID=40&md5=1411778debaf9e11523769a4204a2146,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aging; C-Reactive Protein; Humans; Inflammation; Middle Aged; Retirement; Telomere; Telomere Shortening; C reactive protein; aged; aging; genetics; human; inflammation; metabolism; middle aged; retirement; telomere; telomere shortening; very elderly",,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85130704161,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,54-95,NA,

Several medical and physiological challenges often accompanying the oldest old cancer patients make the choice of the optimal treatment daunting. The current research suggests that people who get adequate treatment can benefit, but it is worth discussing which treatment will benefit them more. High-dose-rate (HDR) 192Ir brachytherapy deserves attention in this context owing to its association with less trauma and reduced complications. Case presentation: An 86-years-old woman with a right glandular lung carcinoma presented with progressive lesions 11 months after chemotherapy. Because of her old age and poor performance status (eastern cooperative oncology group performance status 3), she received HDR 192Ir brachytherapy for her right lung lesion without any common complications, such as pneumothorax and hemorrhage. She continued on 0.25 g oral gefitinib each day after received brachytherapy treatment. The right lung lesion keeps a partial response until 18 months later now. Conclusion: HDR 192Ir brachytherapy can potentially be used as a safe and effective choice for the oldest old with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. It can especially benefit cancer patients with concurrent chemotherapy or targeted therapy. Copyright � 2022 the Author(s).

Recent evidence, largely from cross-sectional studies, suggests that MM could be a risk factor for urinary incontinence (UI). For this reason, we aimed to explore the association between MM at baseline and incident UI, and which individual chronic medical conditions/factors might explain the association between MM and UI, using data from the English Longitudinal Study on Ageing, during ten years of follow-up. MM was defined as having two or more chronic medical conditions; the presence of UI was assessed using self-reported information. A logistic regression analysis, adjusted for baseline potential confounders, was used to assess the association between MM and UI, reporting the data as odds ratios (ORs) with their 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). Of 9432 initial participants, 6742 (mean age: 64.8 years; 53.2 % females) without UI at baseline were included in the analysis. MM was present at baseline in 48.8 % of the participants. People with MM had a significantly higher cumulative incidence of UI than their counterparts, leading to a significantly higher risk of UI also after adjusting for potential confounders at baseline (OR = 1.30; 95 % CI: 1.14�1.48). Among the medical conditions, only three were significantly associated with incident UI, namely asthma, Parkinson's disease, and psychiatric disorders. In conclusion, MM at baseline was associated with an increased risk of UI during ten years of follow-up, suggesting that UI is more likely to be present in people with several chronic medical conditions. � 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Barbagallo M.; Smith L.; Koyanagi A.; Dominguez L.J.; Fazzari A.; Marrone E.; Maggi S.; Ruotolo G.; Castagna A.; Veronese N.,"Barbagallo, Mario (7005672378); Smith, Lee (37117793800); Koyanagi, Ai (57197741912); Dominguez, Ligia J.

94,10.1016/j.exger.2022.111900,Immunophenotypic characterization of B1a lymphocytes in Cuban older adults,"Introduction: B1a lymphocytes are characterized by having a high capacity for self-renewal and production of natural antibodies, in a T-independent manner. There are differences in both the number and composition of mature B lymphocytes throughout life, due to the phenomenon of immunosenescence. Objective: To characterize the immunophenotype of B1a lymphocytes in older Cuban adults with a simplified CD19CD20CD5 panel. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 30 institutionalized Cuban older adults. Characterization of CD19 + CD5+, CD20 + CD5+, and CD19 + CD20+ B lymphocytes in peripheral blood was performed by flow cytometry. For the reading and analysis of the biological samples, a flow cytometer, Beckman Coulter, Gallios, was used. A Microsoft Excel database was created with the information obtained. The sample was divided by sex and age. The data were processed using the statistical program GraphPadPrism version 6.00 using the percentage values and the median for the sample description. Results: The elderly aged 80 years and over showed a decrease in the absolute count of CD19 + CD20+ B lymphocytes, as well as in the percentage and absolute count of CD19 + CD5+ B lymphocytes. On the other hand, they presented higher absolute counts of CD20 + CD5+ lymphocytes in relation to those of the <80-year-old group.

96,10.3390/nu14214617,Effect of Different Nutritional Education Based on Healthy Eating Index for HemoDialysis Patients on Dietary Quality and Muscle Mass,"Background: Hemodialysis patients are at high risk of muscle loss as a result of aging and disease, and combined with inadequate dietary intake. The Healthy Eating Index for HemoDialysis patients (HEI-HD) was developed to assess the dietary quality of hemodialysis patients. The purposes of this study were to examine the effects of different nutritional education models using HEI-HD-based education on dietary quality and muscle mass in hemodialysis patients. Methods: A quasi-experimental study was conducted from May 2019 to April 2021, with four groups, including no course for patients and nurses (Non-C), course for nurses (CN), course for patients (CP), and course for patients and nurses (CPN). The courses were delivered by registered dietitians. The data of 94 patients were collected and analyzed at baseline, after 2 months of intervention, and 2 months follow-up, including demographics, body composition, 3-day dietary records, and hemodialysis dietary knowledge. The HEI-HD index score was calculated. Results: Patients aged 58.3 � 10.1 years. The dietary quality change in the CPN group was improved as compared with the Non-C group (?3.4 � 9.5 vs. 3.0 � 5.5, 0.04). The skeletal muscle mass of the Non-C group at intervention was also significantly lower than baseline, but the CPN group was not. Conclusions: The HEI-HD-based nutritional education for both patients and nurses showed a positive effect on improving the dietary quality and maintaining muscle mass in hemodialysis patients. � 2022 by the authors.",Chen Y.-H.; Liu W.-L.; Duong T.V.; Wong T.-C.; Chen H.-H.; Chen T.-H.; Hsu Y.-H.; Peng S.-J.; Yang S.-H.,"Chen, Yun-Han (57897359300); Liu, Wan-Lin (57897596700); Duong, Tuyen Van (57193346397); Wong, Te-Chih (56988344000); Chen, Hsi-Hsien (35069121000); Chen, Tso-Hsiao (57154867000); Hsu, Yung-Ho (54913888500); Peng, Sheng-Jeng (8161757100); Yang, Shwu-Huey (8676122700)",57897359300; 57897596700; 57193346397; 56988344000; 35069121000; 57154867000; 54913888500; 8161757100; 8676122700,2022,Nutrients,14,21,4617,,,,0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85141640998&doi=10.3390%2fnu14214617&partnerID=40&md5=abf85e8e680b9e75f16947b23c872502,"Diet; Diet Records; Diet, Healthy; Humans; Muscles; Nutritional Status; Renal Dialysis; alcohol; saturated fatty acid; adult; anthropometry; Article; body composition; Charlson Comorbidity Index; controlled study; demographics; dietary intake; dietitian; educational status; exercise; feeding behavior; female; follow up; fruit consumption; fruit juice; grain; Healthy Eating Index; hemodialysis patient; human; international physical activity questionnaire; Kolmogorov Smirnov test; major clinical study; male; marriage; medical record review; metabolic equivalent; milk; muscle mass; nurse; nut; nutrition education; nutritional requirement; occupation; personalized nutrition; physical activity; processed meat; protein intake; quasi experimental study; sea food; skeletal muscle; sociodemographics; sugar-sweetened beverage; Taiwan; vegetable consumption; white meat; whole grain; adverse event; diet; hemodialysis; medical record; muscle; nutritional status",dietary quality; dietitian; hemodialysis; nutritional education; skeletal muscle,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85141640998,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,58.3(10.1),NA,
97,10.1002/fft2.216,Nutritional assessment models for Alzheimer's disease: Advances and perspectives,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease of uncertain pathogenesis that develops in the elderly population and is characterized by loss of cognitive function, memory loss, and deterioration of everyday behavior. The development of biological models of AD is constrained by the complexity of the pathogenesis and multiple causes. Creating disease models can aid in understanding the pathophysiology of AD and developing effective therapeutic drugs. In this review, the animal and cellular models that are currently being utilized to research AD are outlined and described in detail according to modeling approaches. The main animal models are natural aging models, transgenic models, and drug-induced models. The main cellular models are traditional 2D cells, human induced pluripotent stem 2D cells (neurons and glial cells), and 3D cells, as well as organoid models, and the benefits and drawbacks of their various biological models are assessed. They do have their limitations due to an incomplete reflection of AD pathology. Therefore, new models for AD research are needed in the future. The summary of existing models is intended to provide a basis for the subsequent development of new disease models and to provide a reference for the study of disease mechanisms, clinical research, and new drug development in AD. � 2023 The Authors.

98,10.1134/S1027451022050214,Evolution of the Molecular Structure of Partially Dehydrofluorinated Poly(Vinylidene Fluoride) Films upon Storage in Air,"Abstract�: Changes in the molecular composition of the F-2ME poly(vinylidene fluoride) film during its chemical dehydrofluorination and subsequent aging are studied by infrared (IR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction. The byproducts of chemical reactions are also identified. An increase in the reaction time from 10 to 40 min leads to an increase in the thickness of the samples, the concentration of double carbon�carbon bonds and ethoxy groups, as well as to an increase in the absorption peak centered at 3100 cm�1 presumably associated with stretching vibrations of =C�H bonds at the double carbon�carbon bond. Seven days after synthesis new peaks at 1840 and 2040 cm�1 appear in the sample spectra and begin to grow. Their intensities are proportional to each other and are greater the longer is the synthesis duration. Both features are characteristic of the IR spectrum of potassium hydrofluoride. Changes in the IR absorption spectra after a year of storing the samples in air and after additional washing of the sample with a synthesis duration of 40 min in a mixture of acetone and distilled water after 467 days of storage are analyzed. � 2022, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",Zhivulin V.E.; Evsyukov S.E.; Chalov D.A.; Morilova V.M.; Andreychuk V.P.; Khairanov R.K.; Margamov I.G.; Pesin L.A.,"Zhivulin, V.E.

99,10.1016/bs.mcb.2022.12.008,Image processing and supervised machine learning for retinal microglia characterization in senescence,"The process of senescence impairs the function of cells and can ultimately be a key factor in the development of disease. With an aging population, senescence-related diseases are increasing in prevalence. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of cellular senescence within the central nervous system (CNS), including the retina, may yield new therapeutic pathways to slow or even prevent the development of neuro- and retinal degenerative diseases. One method of probing the changing functions of senescent retinal cells is to observe retinal microglial cells. Their morphological structure may change in response to their surrounding cellular environment. In this chapter, we show how microglial cells in the retina, which are implicated in aging and diseases of the CNS, can be identified, quantified, and classified into five distinct morphotypes using image processing and supervised machine learning algorithms. The process involves dissecting, staining, and mounting mouse retinas, before image capture via fluorescence microscopy. The resulting images can then be classified by morphotype using a support vector machine (SVM) we have recently described showing high accuracy. This SVM model uses shape metrics found to correspond with qualitative descriptions of the shape of each morphotype taken from existing literature. We encourage more objective and widespread use of methods of quantification such as this. We believe automatic delineation of the population of microglial cells in the retina, could potentially lead to their use as retinal imaging biomarkers for disease prediction in the future. � 2023 Elsevier Inc.",Choi S.; Hill D.; Young J.; Cordeiro M.F.,"Choi, Soyoung (57226071052); Hill, Daniel (57214381694); Young, Jonathan (58083955200); Cordeiro, Maria Francesca (57210287162)",57226071052; 57214381694; 58083955200; 57210287162,2023,Methods in Cell Biology,,,,,,,0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85147103796&doi=10.1016%2fbs.mcb.2022.12.008&partnerID=40&md5=df7b43a3646c9a4dca5058294bf0a98d,,Microglia; Morphology; Retina; Senescence; Supervised machine learning,Book chapter,Article in press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85147103796,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
100,10.3389/fendo.2022.975209,Obesity paradox and aging: Visceral Adiposity Index and all-cause mortality in older individuals: A prospective cohort study,"Background: The relationship between body mass index (BMI) and mortality in older adults diminished. It is necessary to examine other factors that may accurately predict mortality in older adults. The visceral adiposity index (VAI) is an uncomplicated marker specific to the gender that incorporates anthropometric data and lipid profiles. VAI has been proposed as a marker of visceral adipose tissue dysfunction and of the related cardiometabolic risk. The aim of this study was to evaluate the link of VAI with all-cause mortality among the elderly. Methods: The present prospective cohort study included data from 1999 to 2014 provided by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) in the United States. NHANES participants at or above the age of 65 were included. Data collection was carried out by taking face-to-face interviews, mobile-physical examinations, and lab tests. From the start of the survey to the end of December 2015, mortality-related follow-up statistics are available. The shape of the link between VAI and all-cause mortality was investigated using a restricted cubic spline model. Univariate- and multivariate-adjusted Cox proportional hazard models were estimated for VAI, and the results were presented as regression coefficients and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: The 82,091 NHANES participants represented 442.2 million non-institutionalized residents of the United States. A total of 11,173 older individuals (representing 23.3 million; aged 73.4 � 5.8 years; 56.3% women, 82.7% non-Hispanic Whites, 6.8% non-Hispanic Blacks, and 3.3% Mexican Americans) were included in the study. During the 80-month follow-up period, 4466 fatalities were reported, including 825 deaths from cancer, 867 from heart disease, and 211 from cerebrovascular disease. The restricted cubic spline model demonstrated a robust J-shaped link between VAI and all-cause mortality, revealing a significant decrease in risk within the lower range of VAI, which attained the lowest risk close to 1.7. With VAI greater than 1.7, the risk of mortality increased with the increase of VAI (P for non-linearity = 0.025). In the multivariate-adjusted model, the risk of all-cause mortality was 0.73 (0.56-0.97) and 1.05 (1.01-1.09) in participants with VAI less than 1.7 and VAI greater than or equal to 1.7, respectively. Conclusion: This investigation is a population-based cohort study with high sample sizes and a long-term in older individuals follow-up that showed a J-shaped link between VAI levels and all-cause mortality. Understanding the independent roles of VAI in the relationship between BMI and mortality is crucial to understanding the obesity paradox phenomenon.

101,10.3390/ijerph191912974,Effect of Receiving Financial Support from Adult Children on Depression among Older Persons and the Mediating Role of Social Participation,"Older persons are vulnerable to depression SFduring the ageing process. Financial resources and social participation are expected to have an impact on depressive symptoms. This study investigated the relationship between financial support from children and depression among Chinese older persons, as well as the mediating effect of social participation in this relationship. Data from 7163 participants aged 60 and above were extracted from wave 2015 and 2018 of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Survey (CHARLS). A multivariate regression analysis was performed on both cross-sectional data and two-wave longitudinal data to test our hypotheses. The results revealed that financial support from children was negatively associated with depressive symptoms in both the short-term and the long-term. In addition, this relationship was partially mediated by social participation in the short-term association and fully mediated by social participation in the long-term, where financial support was positively related to social participation, and social participation was negatively associated with depressive symptoms. This study offers an in-depth insight into the relationship between financial support from children and depression among Chinese older persons. Policies and initiatives to stimulate social participation should be promoted to improve older persons� mental health. � 2022 by the authors.",Xia W.; van Wijngaarden J.D.H.; Huijsman R.; Buljac-Samard�i?

102,10.1016/j.compositesb.2022.110195,Influences of surface treatment on the mechanical performances of carbon and basalt textiles-reinforced concretes under harsh environments,"The exposure to elevated temperatures and alkaline concrete pore solution can deteriorate the polymer coating in textile-reinforced concrete (TRC) and degrade its mechanical performance. To address this concern, this study experimentally investigated the influence of surface treatments on the elevated temperature resistance of carbon textile-reinforced concrete (CTRC) and basalt textile-reinforced concrete (BTRC) and durability performance in the marine environment. Three types of surface treatments, including epoxy impregnation, immersion in nano-silica suspension, and combined treatment with the silane coupling agent and nano-silica, were utilized to enhance the elevated temperature resistance and durability properties of CTRC and BTRC. The flexural strength results revealed that the modification effect of nano-silica immersion on the interfacial bonding of CTRC was greater than that of the BTRC, and the improvement can be further enhanced by using the silane coupling agent. In addition, the in-situ three-point flexural tests of CTRC and BTRC specimens were conducted under elevated temperature conditions to examine their elevated temperature resistance. It was found that exposure to elevated temperature decreases flexural performances such as first cracking strength, flexural strength, and flexural toughness of CTRC and BTRC. The elevated temperature resistance of nano-silica-treated specimens is higher than those treated with epoxy impregnation. Furthermore, the treatment with nano-silica increases the aging resistance of both CTRC and BTRC specimens in the simulated marine environment. The research outcomes can serve as a solid base for applying TRC materials in the harsh marine environment. � 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Guo S.; Ren J.; Yang T.; Rahman M.Z.; Shi C.; Zhu D.,"Guo, Shuaicheng (57188570604); Ren, Jinghua (57225879508); Yang, Ting (56473113500); Rahman, Md Zillur (57194717678); Shi, Caijun (7402120890); Zhu, Deju (23013480300)",57188570604; 57225879508; 56473113500; 57194717678; 7402120890; 23013480300,2022,Composites Part B: Engineering,246,,110195,,,,3,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137013568&doi=10.1016%2fj.compositesb.2022.110195&partnerID=40&md5=e3c4a3206d309cd928cbfd5f0fcc3c3e,Basalt; Bending strength; Carbon; Coupling agents; Durability; Impregnation; Reinforced concrete; Silica; Temperature control; Textiles; Elevated temperature; Elevated temperature resistance; Epoxy impregnations; Flexural performance; Marine environment; Mechanical performance; Nano Silica; Silane-coupling agents; Textile reinforced concretes; Textile-reinforced concrete; Surface treatment,Elevated temperature; Flexural performance; Interface; Marine environment; Surface treatment; Textile-reinforced concrete (TRC),Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85137013568,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
103,10.1111/jcmm.17575,Engrailed homeobox 1 transcriptional regulation of COL22A1 inhibits nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell senescence through the G1/S phase arrest,"EN1 is well known as a transcription factor in other tumours, but its role in NPC is unclear. In this study, we first used bioinformatics to analyse GEO data to obtain the differentially expressed gene EN1, and subsequently verified that EN1 was highly expressed in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells by tissue microarrays as well as cell lines. Further, we down-regulated the expression of EN1 in cells for RNA sequencing. The analysis of sequencing results using KEGG and GO revealed significant changes in cell proliferation and cycle function after downregulation of EN1. Meanwhile, we found that cells underwent senescence after inhibition of EN1 under electron microscopy and the SA-?-gal assays. Based on the sequencing results, we verified that EN1 can promote the proliferation and cycle of NPC cells in cell function experiments and animal experiments. To investigate how EN1 affects cell senescence, we found that EN1 transcriptional regulation of COL22A1 regulated cell proliferation and cycle via CDK4/6-cyclin D1-Rb signalling pathway by dual luciferase reporter, Immunoblotting and rescue experiment. Accordingly, we uncovered that EN1 could serve as a target for the regulation of senescence in NPC. � 2022 The Authors.

104,10.1007/s00198-022-06648-9,Bone loss after denosumab discontinuation is prevented by alendronate and zoledronic acid but not risedronate: a retrospective study,"Summary: A retrospective study of 121 patients who stopped denosumab (Dmab) then received no treatment (NT), risedronate (RIS), alendronate (ALN), or zoledronic acid (ZOL). Bone density (spine and hip) during and after Dmab discontinuation was measured. Treatment with ALN or ZOL, not NT and RIS, mitigated BMD loss after Dmab discontinuation. Introduction: Denosumab (Dmab) discontinuation is associated with bone loss and multiple vertebral fractures. The purpose was to compare bone mineral density (BMD) change in patients following Dmab discontinuation with no subsequent treatment (NT) and three bisphosphonate (BP) treatments: risedronate (RIS), alendronate (ALN), and zoledronic acid (ZOL). Methods: In a review of 121 patients aged 71.2 � 8.1�years, discontinuing Dmab (mean 5.4 doses), 33 received NT and 88 received BP (22 RIS; 34 ALN; 32 ZOL). BMD change after 1�year was compared between groups at the lumbar spine (LS), femoral neck (FN), and total hip (TH). Risk factors for bone loss after Dmab discontinuation were compared between groups and incidence of vertebral fractures was determined. Results: Following Dmab discontinuation, LS mean change (g/cm2; 95% CI) was for NT: ? 0.041 (? 0.062 to ? 0.021); RIS: ? 0.035 (? 0.052 to ? 0.017); ALN: ? 0.005 (? 0.020 to 0.009); and ZOL: ? 0.009 (? 0.025 to 0.008). Differences in LS were found between NT and ALN (p�= 0.015), and NT and ZOL (p=0.037), but not between NT and RIS. The only significant difference in TH was found between NT and ZOL (p 0.034) with no group differences in FN. BMD gains during Dmab treatment were associated with BMD loss after Dmab discontinuation. In a subset, discontinuation after Dmab treatment (> 5 doses) followed by ALN (n = 22) and ZOL (n = 11) showed no difference in BMD. Five of 7 vertebral fractures occurred after Dmab discontinuation in NT. Conclusion: Subsequent treatment with ALN or ZOL but not NT and RIS mitigates BMD loss after Dmab discontinuation. � 2023, The Author(s).",Tutaworn T.; Nieves J.W.; Wang Z.; Levin J.E.; Yoo J.E.; Lane J.M.,"Tutaworn, Teerapat (57779145900); Nieves, Jeri W.

105,10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.129553,Understanding ammonia and nitrous oxide formation in typical three-way catalysis during the catalyst warm-up period,"Ammonia (NH3) and nitrous oxide (N2O) have been regarded as the typical secondary pollutants emitted from vehicles equipped with a three-way catalyst (TWC). MultiGas FT-IR Analyzer was applied to determine the outlet gas concentrations in the light-off experiments, in order to understand how different reaction conditions and catalyst aging affect the production of these two pollutants. It was found that N2O formation is favored by the existence of excess oxygen during NO reduction, whereas NH3 is readily formed within the lack of reactive oxygen species. Interestingly, the reduction of NO by H2 in presence of excess oxygen can also lead to NH3 formation when the active metal particles are large enough, which provides the rational explanation why the increased NH3 was emitted from older gasoline vehicles. The loss of the catalytically active sites and reducibility caused by thermal aging requires longer time to warm-up thereby favors the N2O and NH3 formation, which is the major reason for the higher CO, NOx, HC, N2O and NH3 emissions from the old gasoline vehicles than that of low-mileage gasoline vehicles. � 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Wang C.; Xia W.; Yang D.; Zheng T.; Rong Y.; Du J.; Wu B.; Zhao Y.,"Wang, Chengxiong (57192597534); Xia, Wenzheng (57211137669); Yang, Dongxia (56138585600); Zheng, Tingting (55818682300); Rong, Yangjia (57223300105); Du, Junchen (56237496600); Wu, Bingxian (57794117600); Zhao, Yunkun (56110450700)",57192597534; 57211137669; 56138585600; 55818682300; 57223300105; 56237496600; 57794117600; 56110450700,2022,Journal of Hazardous Materials,438,,129553,,,,1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133870773&doi=10.1016%2fj.jhazmat.2022.129553&partnerID=40&md5=71d02d565f219cc73fba169d63fdbcd5,"Air Pollutants; Ammonia; Catalysis; Gasoline; Nitrous Oxide; Oxygen; Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared; Catalysis; Catalysts; Gasoline; Metals; Nitrogen oxides; Oxygen; Pollution; Thermal aging; Vehicles; ammonia; gasoline; hydrogen; nitrous oxide; oxygen; reactive oxygen metabolite; ammonia; gasoline; nitrous oxide; Excess oxygen; Gas concentration; Gasoline vehicle; Nitrous oxide; Outlet gas; Oxide formation; Three way catalysts; Three-way catalysis; Warm-up period; ]+ catalyst; ammonia; catalysis; catalyst; concentration (composition); experimental study; nitrous oxide; reactive oxygen species; reduction; aging; Article; Brunauer Emmett Teller method; catalysis; catalyst; exhaust gas; global warming potential; motor vehicle; oxygen concentration; reduction (chemistry); structure analysis; temperature dependence; air pollutant; catalysis; infrared spectroscopy; Ammonia",Ammonia; Gasoline vehicle; Nitrous oxide; Three-way catalysis,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85133870773,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
106,10.1177/03611981221096666,Hazard Perception in Driving: A Systematic Literature Review,"Hazard perception (HP) is the process of detecting and identifying hazards. Drivers� HP abilities are critical for driving safety. This paper presents a systematic literature review of driver HP, including scientific measures of HP, major human factors affecting HP, and training methods for improving HP skills. Sixty-nine peer-reviewed studies were identified and reviewed. The results showed that common measures of HP include hazard scenario questionnaires, HP reaction time, hazard hit rate, and eye fixation measures such as fixation probability, fixation reaction time, fixation duration, and fixation variance. Major human factors that affect HP include experience, aging, fatigue, distraction, and the use of alcohol and drugs. Various training methods have been developed to train and improve drivers� HP skills. In general, there is evidence in the literature showing the effectiveness of HP training. A combination of complementary training approaches such as instruction, expert demonstration, and active practice with feedback and attention support the use of picture-, video-, computer-, and simulator-based training methods to improve HP performance in shorter HP reaction time, higher hazard hit rate, and better eye scan patterns (more spread scan, more anticipatory scan). These findings could guide future work developing and designing HP training programs. Three future research areas are identified and discussed: the need for standardized HP tests, long-term testing of HP training programs, and new HP questions and challenges brought by partially automated vehicles. � SAGE Publications Ltd.

107,10.1038/s41598-022-05986-2,Lipid metabolism analysis in liver of different chicken genotypes and impact on nutritionally relevant polyunsaturated fatty acids of meat,"Humans and mammalian species are unable to synthesize significant amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), which therefore must be introduced with the diet. In birds, lipogenesis takes place primarily in the liver, whereas adipose tissue serves as the storage site for triacylglycerols (TG, composed by 80�85% esterified fatty acids). However, both the nature (unsaturation level, n-3, or n-6 series) and the allocation (such as constituents of complexed lipids) of PUFA are very important to evaluate their function in lipid metabolism. The objective of the present investigation was to study the liver lipid metabolism, with particular attention to non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), TG, phospholipids (PL), FADS2 gene expression, and ?6-desaturase activity of three chicken genotypes, Leghorn (Leg), Ross 308 (Ross), and their crossbreed (LxR), by LC/MS analysis. The concentration of single fatty acids in muscle was quantified by GC-FID. The results showed that the Ross has a lipid metabolism related mainly to storage and structural roles, exhibiting higher levels of TG, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) that are largely unsaturated. Meanwhile Leg showed a relevant amount of n-3 NEFA characterized by a higher phosphatidylserine (PS) unsaturation level, FADS2 gene expression and enzyme activity. The LxR seem to have a moderate trend: n-6 and n-3 NEFA showed intermediate values compared with that of the Ross and Leg and the TG trend was similar to that of the Ross, while PE and PC were largely unsaturated (mainly 6 and 7 UNS most of the metabolic energy for storage fatty acids in their tissues (TG) whereas, the Leg birds were characterized by different lipid metabolism showing in their liver a higher content of n-3 NEFA and higher unsaturation level in PS. Furthers details are needed to better attribute the lipid energy to the different metabolic portion. � 2022, The Author(s).",Cartoni Mancinelli A.; Di Veroli A.; Mattioli S.; Cruciani G.; Dal Bosco A.; Castellini C.,"Cartoni Mancinelli, Alice (57191847168); Di Veroli, Alessandra (24334463000); Mattioli, Simona (54395625300); Cruciani, Gabriele (7005031076); Dal Bosco, Alessandro (6602560210); Castellini, Cesare (7004212390)",57191847168; 24334463000; 54395625300; 7005031076; 6602560210; 7004212390,2022,Scientific Reports,12,1,1888,,,,9,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123973268&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-022-05986-2&partnerID=40&md5=9ee956f05a1f512be02942c796754147,"Animals; Chickens; Energy Metabolism; Fatty Acid Desaturases; Fatty Acids, Unsaturated; Genotype; Hybridization, Genetic; Linoleoyl-CoA Desaturase; Lipid Metabolism; Lipidomics; Liver; Muscle, Skeletal; Nutritive Value; Phenotype; Poultry Products; acyl coenzyme A desaturase; linoleoyl coenzyme A desaturase; unsaturated fatty acid; animal; chicken; comparative study; energy metabolism; genetics; genotype; growth, development and aging; hybridization; lipid metabolism; lipidomics; liver; metabolism; nutritional value; phenotype; poultry product; skeletal muscle",,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123973268,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
108,10.30476/IJCBNM.2022.94547.2003,Women�s Empowerment Status in Menopausal Transition: A Cross-sectional Study,"Background: Women�s empowerment status in menopausal transition is of great importance due to the increasing trend of life expectancy and population aging. This study was conducted to evaluate the empowerment status of women during the menopausal transition in Gonabad, Iran. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in Gonabad city in Northeast of Iran from April 2017 to March 2018. Cluster sampling was used for selecting 680 women who were in the menopausal transition. Demographic questionnaire and Women�s Empowerment Status Questionnaire-a researcher-made questionnaire-was used for data collection. Pearson�s correlation coefficient, one-way ANOVA, and linear regression were used to analyze the data using SPSS version 16; A p-value less than 0.05 was considered as significant. Results: The majority of the participants 510 (76.10%) had a high empowerment level. A high empowerment status in the family, economic, social, and health domains was observed in 499 (74.50%), 534 (79.70%), 523 (78.05%), and 493 (73.60%) participants, respectively. The majority of the participants had moderate empowerment status in political 427 (70.40%) and religious domains 464 (69.30%). There was a negative correlation between the total empowerment score and the participants� age (P<0.001), husband�s age (P<0.001), and the number of children (P<0.001). There was a positive correlation between the total empowerment score and education (P=0.003) as well as age of marriage (P=0.03). Conclusion: Overall empowerment status of women in menopausal transition in Gonabad-Iran was high. However, in political and religious domains, the status was moderate. We suggest that empowered women should be invited to share their experiences with other females. Development of social networks could provide the basis for sharing the experiences of these women and helps policy makers to develop community empowerment programs. � International Journal of Community Based Nursing and Midwifery.",Bahri N.; Mirzaiinajmabadi K.; Esmaeily H.; Roudsari R.L.,"Bahri, Narjes (55699703900); Mirzaiinajmabadi, Khadigeh (57226695538); Esmaeily, Habibollah (55864410200); Roudsari, Robab Latifnejad (57190706939)",55699703900; 57226695538; 55864410200; 57190706939,2022,International Journal of Community Based Nursing and Midwifery,10,4,,279,289,10,0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85140352439&doi=10.30476%2fIJCBNM.2022.94547.2003&partnerID=40&md5=2d102a3959051a1e759b1a083178a88e,Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Empowerment; Female; Humans; Marriage; Menopause; Women's Rights; child; cross-sectional study; empowerment; female; human; marriage; menopause; women's rights,Economic; Empowerment; Family; Menopause; Politics,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85140352439,1,0,0,Iran,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,680,0,1,0,0,NA,NA,
109,10.1111/jocd.14907,Development of stable tocopherol succinate-loaded ethosomes to enhance transdermal permeation: In vitro and in vivo characterizations,"Background: Tocopherol succinate (TS) represents synthetic derivative of ?-tocopherol (vitamin E), it act as anti-aging, moisturizing, and antioxidant. Ultraviolet (UV) photo stability of TS is low, and it cause skin irritation. Aim: To develop tocopherol succinate loaded ethosomal gel for topical TS delivery and to evaluate its moisturizing and anti-aging effects. Method: Cold method technique was used to produce ethosomal formulations (N�=�9) by varying ethanol and lipid concentrations (F1�F9). The most optimized formulation (F5) was selected for further study on the basis of characterization. F5 Formulation was incorporated into gel. Ex vivo permeation study was done by using Franz diffusion cell. Non-invasive in vivo study was performed using corneometer for the evaluation of skin moisture content and skin mechanical properties by using cutometer, for 12�weeks on human subjects (N�=�13). Results: Particle size (PS), zeta potential (ZP) and polydispersity index (PDI), Entrapment efficiency were found to be 179.1�nm, ?13.7�mV and 0.345, and 99.71%, respectively. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) depicted spherical ethosomal particles. Ethosomal gel and control gel were evaluated for conductivity and pH. Rheological analysis revealed a non-Newtonian flow. The release profile showed initial burst and then, sustained release, release data followed Korsmeyer�Peppas model. TS-loaded ethosomal gel appeared physically stable and showed significant results in terms of skin capacitance and mechanical properties. Conclusion: The prepared ethosomal gel formulation containing TS is more stable with enhanced antioxidant, moisturizing properties, and increased TS deposition into the skin layer. � 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",Akhtar N.; Akhtar N.,"Akhtar, Naheed (57545383700); Akhtar, Naveed (15055469300)",57545383700; 15055469300,2022,Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology,21,10,,4942,4955,13,7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126811513&doi=10.1111%2fjocd.14907&partnerID=40&md5=ae807ff6ce6ca61901a8394a0846435d,"Administration, Cutaneous; alpha-Tocopherol; Antioxidants; Humans; Liposomes; Skin; Skin Absorption; alpha tocopherol succinate; liposome; phospholipid; polymer; triethanolamine; alpha tocopherol; antioxidant; antiaging activity; Article; conductance; differential scanning calorimetry; dispersity; drug delivery system; drug formulation; drug release; drug targeting; emulsion; ex vivo study; hyperpigmentation; in vitro study; in vivo study; infrared spectroscopy; nonhuman; particle size; patch test; pH; scanning electron microscopy; shear stress; skin irritation; skin penetration; skin water loss; transmission electron microscopy; ultraviolet spectrophotometry; zeta potential; chemistry; cutaneous drug administration; human; metabolism; skin; skin absorption",anti-aging; cutometer; ethosomes; ex vivo permeation; tocopherol succinate,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85126811513,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
